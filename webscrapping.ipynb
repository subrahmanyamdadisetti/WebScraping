       " <span>Build and Design: 8/10<br/>The iPhone 7 Plus does not come with a drastically new design. You can look at it more of adding finesse to the iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6s Plus designs. The similar design is now in its third generation. Is Apple holding out till next year, to release a brand new design language? Not that it is bad in the current state, but it dosen’t make it stand out from its predecessors. Not to mention, the designs from its Android arch-rivals has certainly seen changes over the years.The first thing that you will notice when you handle the phone, is that the visible antenna lines have been nicely camouflaged. While it is still visible to an extent on the Rose Gold, Silver and Gold variants of the phone; on the Matte Black and Jet Black versions, you have to really look for it.The rounded edges, power / standby, volume rocker buttons and the ringer notch are all in the same spot as the iPhone 6s Plus. So is the home button. But there’s a catch. The circular button isn’t a push button anymore but is supported by the Taptic Engine’s feedback mechanism. The Taptic Engine which supports the 3D touch mechanism for the display, also controls the touch response on the button. You can set the levels of feedback for the button, and honestly after a while you forget that the button isn’t there. It is one cool implementation. And it is such fine design details that make Apple products what they are.The edges are 7.3mm thick and it weighs around 188 grams. While the thickness is the same as its predecessor, it is around 4 grams lighter. In terms of overall feel of the phone and sturdiness, there isn’t much different from the iPhone 6s Plus. And the complaint we had with the 6s Plus remains. The iPhone 7 Plus offers a terrible body to screen ratio as compared to some of its Android flagships such as the Galaxy S7 edge or the newly launched Google Pixel XL, which offers 5.5-inch display in a more compact body.The rear side has a bump in the top left hand corner which houses two 12MP camera sensors. Snapping on cover on the iPhone brings the camera bump with the plane of the iPhone back.There is one important addition though. It is IP67 certified which makes it water and dust resistant.Metal back is still as slippery as its predecessors. Apple has some really cool leather covers with metallic button areas if you have buttery hands. They sell separately, of course. Snapping them on further reduces ease of one-handed use. And no, you cannot use the last generation covers on this phone for obvious reasons. I got the matte black variant to review, and it looks quite wonderful, as compared to the other three colours. The Jet Black variant is still the more premium variant, and I would not be surprised if we see more Jet black or piano black phone colours over the coming months.<br/><br/>Features: 8.5/10<br/>Thanks to a limited product portfolio in its smartphone segment, Apple really ensures that the internals get a good amount of upgrade in the coming generations. To that extent, the iPhone 7 Plus comes with the Apple A10 Fusion chipset which has a quad-core processor clocked at 2.23GHz. This is paired with 3GB RAM. It comes with a 5.5-inch Full HD resolution display.There are three storage variants – 32GB, 128GB and 256GB of which we have the 256GB variant for review. There is no expandable storage.<br/><br/>It runs on iOS 10. A single nano SIM card slot is present on the right hand side, just below the power/standby button. It supports dual band Wi-Fi 802.11 ac, Wi-fi hotspot, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS with A-GPS and GLONASS, NFC only for Apply Pay which is not available in India. And also, no FM radio.The big changes on the features front is the dropping of the 3.5mm audio jack. You will need a lightning port connector on your earphones. Apple bundles a pair. Other option is using a Bluetooth headset to enjoy your music. Apple has also bundled in a lightning port to 3.5 mm audio jack adapter for those who still want to rely on their personal audio gear. This is one move that drew a lot of flak as a lot of us still prefer using personal earphones / headphones which still have a 3.5mm jack. But give it some time and you will see a lot more lightning port earphone accessories, going by Apple’s history of spawning off accessories market segments. The iPhone 7 Plus comes with stereo speakers finally, with one being at the base and the other on the earpiece speaker.<br/><br/>On the camera front, you get two 12MP sensors on the back and there is a 7MP front-facing FaceTime HD camera. Apple has implemented the dual rear cameras in a way that you get to use true 2x optical zoom.<br/><br/>Display: 8/10<br/>The iPhone 7 Plus sports a 5.5inch FullHD display which gives a pixel density of 401PPI. The panel is an LED backlit IPS LCD panel. However with the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple claims to be using a wide gamut display (cinema standard). When placed side by side with the iPhone 6s/6s Plus, I noticed that the iPhone 7 Plus had a slight warm tinge to it. The iPhone 7 Plus is definitely a notch brighter than the 6s Plus. The Night Shift mode lets you select the time when you want to display to control the blue light, and it also lets you select the shade of yellow that you are comfortable with. This added granularity is a nice touch.<br/><br/>Colour reproduction is spot on and it is still a class-leading display among smartphones. Colours aren’t unnecessarily vivid. Legibility in sunlight is not an issue, as its auto-brightness mode works quite well. The display, as has been the case with previous generations, is quite glossy. It was while shooting in bright sunlight where at times all I could see on the display was my reflection, specially when shooting from chest height. Not so much at the eye level.<br/><br/>The black levels on the display are quite good and watching movies or playing games is a lot of fun. Games such as Vain Glory, Real Racing 3, Nova 3 look gorgeous on this calibrated display.<br/><br/>Software: 8/10<br/>Apple iPhone 7 Plus comes with the latest iOS 10 operating system. The one running on the review unit was 10.0.3 on which majority of the testing was done, before switching to the 10.1 beta to access the Portrait mode in the Camera app. The iOS 10 is refined and operationally quite smooth on most occasions. There were a few instances of apps not registering action on first tap.<br/><br/>iOS 10 dosen’t look very different from its predecessor, but packs in a lot of new features. For starters, you can now uninstall the native Apple apps if you don’t need them. I figured I would do without Stocks, Home and a couple of other apps which I deleted. Technically it just hides the icon and deletes all the app data from your phone. You can reinstall the app by searching for it in the App store.<br/><br/>The 3D touch still offers the Peek and Pop features, with support added to a lot more apps than we had seen when the 6s Plus launched.<br/><br/>Messages has got a complete revamp with the app letting you add in GIF animations; finger gestures –  creating animations such as heart break, beating heart and more; send photos from the camera while in the app; share music and so on. While these additions are playing catch up to the likes of apps such as Telegram, it makes little sense to use Messages if your family or friend circle isn’t on Apple devices.Control Centre has been modified, with the music control shifted to a new tab. Also the four icons at the base – torch, timer, calculator and camera support 3D gestures, letting you access more functions without leaving the Control Centre screen. iOS 10 also lets you do a lot from the lock screen itself. You can swipe left to open the camera or swipe right to access widgets or swipe from the top to bottom to see notifications. There’s also the ‘Raise to Wake up’ feature which wakes up the display when you just lift your iPhone to your face if its lying in the sleep mode on your desk.Music app has got some design changes. Instead of My Music, you now get a Library tab which lets you enlist a variety of options from Playlists, Artists, Album, Songs and so on. You can download songs if you are a subscriber, optimise storage by setting a limit on auto downloads, auto-generated playlists in the ‘For You’ section and more.<br/><br/>The Photos app has got some additions in the form of Memories, where in iOS makes albums based on your photos shot at a particular location. In short, this is Apple Photos playing catch up to Google Photos, which has much more interesting features.Siri was the star feature of the iPhones when it was first announced back in 2011. Since then Google has been getting better with its AI-backed virtual assistant game – first Google Now and this year the Google Assistant. Between the two, we noticed that the Assistant was able to understand accents better and let you have contextual conversations, whereas with Siri you still have to pay attention to your diction.Even asking Siri simple questions such as “what was the iPhone 7 Plus pricing for India” or “when was Siri released?” the responses weren’t very forth coming. Also between the two I also realised that most of the times you have to ask Siri questions in a particular way, and you cannot ask follow up questions and get satisfactory responses as you do with Assistant. Apple says Siri is a self-learning system, so maybe it needs more usage. But after using it for a week, it isn’t significantly better than Google Assistant. One thing I would grant Siri is the way it presents card information – is much more richer and informative than Google.<br/><br/>Performance: 9/10<br/>Call quality is top notch with audible earpiece speaker even in high traffic situations. The iPhone 7 Plus supports Cat 9 LTE, voice over LTE, Wi-fi calling. I did not find any connectivity issues with a Jio SIM card on it, and was able to make successful VoLTE calls.With the latest Apple A10 Fusion chipset paired with 3GB of RAM (the highest seen on an Apple iPhone) you get a wicked fast device. The A10 Fusion chipset houses a quad-core processor, with two high power cores clocked at 2.23GHz and two low power saving ones. There’s a six-core GPU as well. The single core performance score of 3445 observed on GeekBench 4 was the highest we have seen on any smartphone we have tested so far. Even the multi-core score is only second to Huawei P9. The AnTuTu benchmark gives 186093 – again the highest score.<br/><br/>In terms of raw numbers, the iPhone 7 Plus comes out tops. In real life usage though, the phone runs lag free and things such as app switching, finger print scanning work fast. The phone does get warm when you are on a particularly photography heavy day, but never crossing 36-38 degree mark on the Fluke IR thermometer.<br/><br/>Gaming on the phone is smooth. No frame drops were observed on high end games such Vain Glory, Nova 3, Real Racing 3 and so on. Watching movies with the stereo speakers is quite a fine experience. The speakers are quite loud, but in certain applications such as YouTube, we observed that using the headphones was a battery option.<br/><br/>Camera: 8.5/10<br/>One of the highlight feature of the iPhone 7 Plus is the presence of the dual rear camera setup. Sure, this isn’t the first time we are seeing a dual camera on a smartphone. Huawei and LG have done this before. But just like all things Apple, the implementation is different. There are two 12MP sensors, one is standard camera which has an equivalent focal length of 28mm (with an f/1.8 aperture) and the other sensor has a telephoto lens having a 56mm focal length (with an f/2.8 aperture). The standard 28mm lens comes with OIS, whereas the telephoto lens does not. This implementation lets the iPhone 7 Plus offer true 2x optical zoom. The Camera app lets you easily switch regular wide angle shot and the 2x optical zoom shot. This ensures that there is no loss in detail when taking 2x zoom photos.While it may seem like they are two different cameras, they do tend to work together everytime you fire off the shutter. You can use these two lenses when shooting videos as well, but switching to the 2x zoom, will remove the OIS feature. The two lenses work quite well in the Portrait mode which is currently available on the iOS 10.1 beta. Also another thing to note is that the telephoto lens can only be used in well lit situations, and if the light isn’t enough, the iPhone 7 Plus will use the regular lens with 2x digital zoom. Apple’s image processor takes this decision on the fly.<br/><br/>The iPhone 7 Plus has a 7MP front facing FaceTime HD camera and quad LED flash unit on the rear side. Features carried forward from the iPhone 6s Plus include the live photos, phase detect autofocus. The Camera app is also similar to the one seen in the last generation.<br/><br/>Coming to the image quality, the iPhone 7 Plus just like its predecessors, delivers. Colours come out natural and at times it may look a bit too dull when compared with images coming out of say a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge or even the latest Google Pixel XL. Apple iPhone 7 Plus gives a neutral output, with good amount of detail, great dynamic range. Optical zoom works quite well in bright outdoors. You also get the option of using 10x digital zoom for still images and 6x digital zoom for video. Use this only in emergency situations as there is a lot of artifacts you will get in the final images. When forcing the HDR mode, we also noticed some artifacts around the edges if the subject moved too much, as is seen in the fur of the labrador in the image below, around the right paw.Panoramas come out really good, and there is good exposure control. You can also get HDR Panorama shots with the new camera app. There were instances when shooting panoramas in bright sunlight, where I noticed mild change in the sky exposure. But the image stitching is relatively better than that seen on Android phones. The 2x optical zoom also offers Panorama mode.Focussing is relatively quick. But time to first shot is still slow as compared to the quicker ways in which you can turn on cameras in some Android phones. Double tapping the home button to launch the camera is really a no brainer which Apple should implement.Low light image quality is good, but in a side by side comparison with the Google Pixel XL, I noticed that the Pixel XL clearly took the lead there. I’m not saying iPhone 7 Plus is a bad camera in low light – far from it. But the noise control, detail retention, dynamic range seen on the Galaxy S7 and Pixel XL is notches above the iPhone 7 Plus.The Portrait mode was one area which Apple spoke about a lot during the launch. During the time of testing it was only available on the beta, though it is now available to everyone. Once you turn on the Portrait mode, you will get instructions below the rounded square frame, whether you need to move closer or farther. Once you get the lock, the focussing frame becomes yellow and you fire the shutter. Images clicked in the portrait mode turned out good, it works specially well when you are in a well lit area and there is respectable distance between the subject and the background. The blurring of the background is nicely done and isn’t as aggressive as what we have seen with other dual camera phones. The good thing is that you can see the shallow depth of field while you are composing the shot. But the problem is that it will take some practise to get the shot faster. Your subject will have to really be patient till you get everything right. This may be cool when shooting friends and family, but if you are on the street and want to get that quick portrait with a defocussed background, then that can prove difficult.<br/><br/>On the video front, the iPhone 7 Plus can shoot up to 4K resolution videos. The OIS on the phone ensures that there is minimal camera shake, although you do see a slight jello effect when walking and shooting. The camera region does get warm when shooting videos. But not enough to cause it to shut down, as I have observed with Sony flagship smartphones.<br/><br/>Battery Life: 8/10<br/>Coming with a 2900mAh non-removable battery, the iPhone 7 Plus has seen a bump in this department as compared to the previous generation. In a word, the battery life is excellent. There wasn’t a day in the two weeks that I was using the phone, when I found the battery to be draining out before my work day. In fact, with a 100 percent charge at 8AM, and after a day of regular usage, I would still have around 20 percent charge remaining till around 10PM. Heavy usage including playing games, streaming video, calling, messaging via multiple apps, using the camera extensively did drain out the battery by around 9PM. The battery usage numbers show some really good numbers with a 16 hour plus usage time and standby time of over 40 hours. It also offers the Low Power mode, which further extends the battery.Charging seems to take forever though. It easily takes over 3 hours to go from sub-10 percent to 100 percent charge. In an age of rapid charging technologies available on all Android flagships, where you can go from 0 to 100 in just over an hour’s time, Apple’s charging technology seems dated. The good thing is that the iPhone 7 Plus can hold the charge for that much longer vis-a-vis an Android phone. But it’s about time Apple get some sort of quick charging onboard. Is it holding that out for the 10th anniversary edition?<br/><br/>Verdict and Price in India<br/>All things considered, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus is a great device. It excels in departments such as battery life, performance, display among other things. The iOS 10 also brings a lot of new features to the table. The implementation of the dual rear camera is quite intelligent. Also portrait mode will be quite loved by those who love that kind of photography – it will just require patience though. While the camera image quality is good, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus still leaves scope for improvement in the low light photography department as we observed in out Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus shootout.<br/><br/>If you are on the iPhone 6/6 Plus and are looking for an upgrade, the iPhone 7/7 Plus could be considered. For the 6s / 6s Plus users, there is little to no reason for upgrade. You would rather wait out this iteration for the 10th year iPhone edition.<br/><br/>While the iPhone 7 Plus is good, it looks like Apple is leaving the better things for its 10th year edition. Things such as similar design, no quick charging support, similar camera app (which still makes you dig into the General settings to make tweaks in resolution and the like) among other areas have been carried forward from previous two generations. There’s a high possibility that some of these issues would hopefully be addressed in the next gen iPhone.<br/><br/>Prices start from Rs 72,000 for 32GB, Rs 82,000 for 128GB and Rs 92,000 for the 256GB variant of the iPhone 7 Plus. The prices are high, and yes you can get a lot more in that amount. But if you want to invest in an iPhone, this is what you have to pay. A lot of telcos are offering the iPhone 7/7 Plus with various data packs as compared to Android competition. Thankfully, the pricing is in line with what it was last year. If 5.5-inch is too large a size for you, then opt for the iPhone 7 which still retains most of the internal features seen on the iPhone 7 Plus.<br/><br/>If you are still not convinced about the iPhone 7 Plus, or are short on budget, the Android flagships that you can consider include the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge which is still a powerful device. I have been testing the Google Pixel XL for some days now, and it has already shown its capability in the low light department as compared to the iPhone 7 Plus. So that could also be a possible contender.</span>\n",

       " <span>I'm writing this review after using the iPhone 7 for about a week, here are the things that I liked, disliked and thought are worth to mention.<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>-WHATS IN THE BOX-<br/>==================<br/>1. THE IPHONE 7 ITSELF<br/>2. THE LIGHTNING EARPODS<br/>3. LIGHTNING TO 3.5 MM JACK CONVERTOR<br/>4. LIGHTNING TO USB CABLE<br/>5. POWER ADAPTER<br/>6. SIM EJECTOR PIN<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>-THE DESIGN-<br/>=============<br/>So the new iPhone 7 black variant has a nice aluminum body with matte finish. the iPhone 7 is also now waterproof with IP67 rating. the 12mp rear camera with the led flash are present on the back, the power button with the I'm tray are present on the right side, the volume rockers and the profile button are located on the left side, on the front we have the 7mp f2.2 camera, ear piece, sensors and the 4.7 inch 1334x750-pixel resolution at 326 ppi display and the home button are present, now the home button is not really a button, it has what apple calls the taptic engine which gives a haptic feedback and simulated a real button, but doesn't really feels like a button, you can select the type of haptic feedback you like form three options. the home button also has the fingerprint scanner or touch id, its a nice quick and accurate scanner. the 4.7 inch display great too. with great viewing angles, vibrancy, and color reproduction. the colors looks natural and with nice saturation and contrast. expected nothing less from apple on this. now the biggest down side of this phone is the removal of the headphone, apple says that the lightning connector works great as an audio source for headphones, but I still miss my the 3.5mm jack, apple did provide a small lightning to 3.5mm adapter which is something you also need to carry around if you want to listen from your normal headphones or you have to switch to Bluetooth audio.<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>-THE CAMERA-<br/>=============<br/>the camera has a good improvement from the iPhone 6s, it doesn't have dual cameras like the iPhone 7 plus, but it performs great. the are very detailed with great color reproduction, contrast level. the images are vibrant with good amount of saturation and sharpness. the 12mp camera now also have optical image stabilization so the video are nice and stabilized as the iPhone 6s it also shoots in 4k, the front facing 7mp camera has been improved a lot, its has nice wide frame and the image quality is also very natural, the video quality of the front facing camera is also nice you have to be careful with lighting or otherwise the contrast levels sometimes gets messed up.<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>-THE PERFORMENCE-<br/>======================<br/>the iPhone 7 has the apple A10 fusion chips with six core graphics and 2gb of ram, the new processor performs great, it easily handles heavy usage and gaming, multitasking is also very fluid, it easily handles tons of app running in the background simultaneously with just 2gb of ram. the iPhone 7 comes with the new iOS 10 which has great features like the new version of siri and improved 3d touch. if you are a moderate user it will work flawlessly for you.<br/> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>-THE BATTERY-<br/>================<br/>the iPhone 7 only have a 1960 mah battery, but don't let that small size fool you it easily lasts a day even under heavy usage you can easily get it to work till night. another down side of this phone is that it doesn't support fast charging, it takes around 2 hours to fully charge from 10% to 100%. but you can also use an ipad charger to make the charging speed a little bit faster.<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>- THE PROS AND CONS-<br/>-THE PROS-<br/>==========<br/>1. GREAT BUILD QUALITY<br/>2. WATERPROOF<br/>3. GREAT CAMERA<br/>4. GREAT DISPLAY<br/>5. FINGERPRINT SCANNER<br/>6. GREAT FOR GAMING<br/>7. GREAT FOR MULTITASKING<br/>8. STEREO SPEAKERS<br/><br/>-THE CONS-<br/>============<br/>1. NO HEADPHONE JACK<br/>2. NO FAST CHARGING<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>FINAL VERDICT- The iPhone is a great flagship smartphone with great specs, performance and camera, it might not be that much worth to upgrade from an iPhone 6 or 6s but if you want the better camera, waterproofing you can definitely go for it.<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>[...]<br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>THANK YOU</span>\n",

       " <span>Firstly, let me clarify.. I do not belong to Apple Die hard fans and followers' club.<br/><br/>I too was drawn towards this device as a replacement when my Moto E First Gen one fine day stopped working and didn't recover.<br/><br/>So this is a transition from Android to iOS.<br/><br/>Am I missing Android ? Honestly - NO.<br/><br/>I thought it's time to buy a perfect and latest device for myself, not because I was completely sure of what it does, just because I could now afford it.<br/><br/>I know, iPhone 8 and iPhone X are in the market today. But this phone in every respect is still relevant today and in no way can be considered outdated. If you wish you buy an iPhone that doesn't hit your pocket much and is not outdated, this is the most perfect phone to buy today.<br/><br/>Buying 6 or 6s would be a risk because apple might stop supporting its update in a few years.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, this review is not from a crazy Apple product lover. (Although it may sound like one)<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>1. The screen dimensions and phone size is perfect. It's exactly what I need. Not too thick and not extremely flimsy. Though some might prefer the iPhone 7 plus, I think it's too big to carry in your pocket.<br/><br/>2. Processor and Speed: this I noticed not just about this iPhone but for iPad also, the processor speed is really awesome. Windows laptops, android phones and tabs do hang and freeze. This phone in last one year has NEVER. It might not sound much of a big deal but usually phones hang when you desperately need them in urgency and you don't want to be in that position ever.<br/><br/>3. Screen Quality: the screen looks amazing and Colors are extremely fine.<br/><br/>4. Camera: now please note that this is not a DSLR. So no matter how much the phone companies advertise, phone cameras will always be inferior to a professional DLSR. That's the reason why camera companies aren't out of business. Having said that, the camera of this phone (both front and back) are really good and they do their job.<br/><br/>6. No Headphone Jack: I thought it would be a matter of concern, but it isn't. It has only motivated me to take care of my headphone even more and that's the only reason they are still intact and working properly. I am sure you won't miss the jack. Besides, if you fear losing the small adapter, it's better to buy Bluetooth headphones. They fit it really well with this phone.<br/><br/>7. Cross platform flexibility: this is what I was most worried about. How this device would blend in with my windows laptop and all other apps and features which I earlier used in windows and Android. Surprisingly, the transition was smooth and hassle free. There may be people who disagree, but I never missed any feature which android provided. Infact, itunes, iCloud and other apple features have made the life much easier as compared to android.<br/><br/>8. 32 GB storage: I think it's sufficient today. Most people use their phones as storage devices. If you're one of them then even 256GB variant is not enough. So install the apps you actually use, backup the photos in to your laptop regularly, put videos and songs only the ones you listen and actually watch. You will surprise yourself that filling up 32GB space is also difficult.<br/><br/>Now, most importantly...<br/>CONS:<br/>1. Body Finishing: You have to have a back cover for this phone in order to avoid it slipping from your hands. The tighter you grip it without cover, the easily it would slip.<br/>Also, I initially used a cover which had a seive pattern on it. The same pattern got imprinted on back of the phone (though not easily visible). Go for an all solid or all plastic cover which can provide grip.<br/><br/>2. Battery backup: The battery backup of this phone is bit of a problem. With moderate usage also, it can consume battery before the end of the day and you have to be very economical about it.<br/><br/>3. No dual sim: I know, many would frown after reading this. And I know why Apple has still not released a dual sim iPhone.. but I wish this phone was dual sim. The other 2 cons can be mitigated, this one however can only be settled by having a backup phone. Add the Dual sim feature and apple would bring in a swarm of new users who hesitated from iPhone.<br/><br/>iPhone ACCESSORIES RECOMMENDATION<br/><br/>1. Screen Guard: you may go for any standard screen guard but honestly you don't need one. No screen guard can protect your screen from breaking. I have not used any screen guard for more than year and the screen looks as new. Just make sure you don't put the keys and phone in the same pocket and surely phone will shine for years. Also, let me mention here that my phone HAS FALLEN from a decent height face down on solid floor twice but the glass is strong enough to sustain without absolutely no physical damage.<br/><br/>2. Back cover: I think this is a must accessory. You need not spend much on this. Egotude transparent color (black shade) will go perfectly with it. It provides the necessary grip and scratch resistance to your phone back.<br/><br/>3. Headphones: in case you lose your Apple earphones, as per your budget, buy a Bluetooth headset, something that suits your pocket and you're good to go.<br/><br/>4. Cleaning Spray and Cloth: If you wish to keep your phone new and clean, please invest in this. It's a very small investment but the returns are huge. Buy any camera lens cleaning Spray and soft cloth. Every 10-15 days, take the phone out of cover and thoroughly clean the phone and cover as well. Your phone will shine a little longer and will look brand new for years. All it needs is just a little touch of care from you.<br/><br/>Hope the review helps. Cheers 🖖🏻</span>\n",

       " <span>NOTE:  This review is addressed to that class of people for whom Rs.60000-70000 smartphone is once in five years thing.<br/><br/>Before you judge the rating which I have given and draw conclusions, I just want to let people who read this review realize that I am after technology with some innovation and out of the box concept as I never use a smartphone beyond 12 months.  In this process, I literally used every high-end smartphone that was launched after iPhone 3G (my first hold of a smartphone), be it xperia, blackberry, samsung, nexus, HTC, what not!<br/><br/>Now, coming to the point of fake ratings.  I am a bit surprised to see so many negative reviews for an iPhone 7 on Amazon.  KINDLY SEE FLIPKART, without the product even launched on their site, there are 864 ratings and as much as 4.9 stars out of 5 and not a single review (I am enclosing a pic for your reference).  So, there is something which doesn't catch our eye.  But these are the lame tricks that get played when you go neck to neck in competition, it applies to either side.<br/><br/>ABOUT APPLE<br/>Undoubtedly, I give huge credit to Apple for introducing smartphone concept and in the process they slowly killed the once mighty Blackberry.  Like Thomas Edison, credit goes to Apple for inventing such a masterpiece.  But we are still not using the same bulb which Edison has invented.  There are so many companies which are reinventing bulbs every year.  Apple followed it up for few years with some changes in iPhone to keep the customer base solid.  There is so much hype created over every Apple launch and in the process, the adversaries tried to copy the launch styles of Apple.  So, they clearly have the margin.  But, they are surely lagging behind in terms of innovation.  This year iPhone 7 is one that's a perfect example.<br/><br/>COMING TO THE PHONE<br/>Watched the launch event so closely, like I always do every year.  I was using an iPhone 6 and was waiting for 7 (I have had an occasion to handle and experience both iPhone 7 and 7 plus even before they were launched in India).  And finally ended up with Galaxy S7 Edge for a reason (BEFORE COMMENTING, RE-READ WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN IN THE FIRST TWO PARAGRAPHS OF MY REVIEW).  I opted for S7 Edge for its curvy screen design with brilliant colours and the camera which beats the iPhone  The dual camera on iPhone 7 plus is not new to the world before its launch.  Secondly, they have their eyes set for the 10th Annniversary of iPhone in 2017 and are holding their cards till then.  Both iOS and Android have their own pros and cons.  This is the area which I am carefully and deliberately side lining and focusing on the phone.<br/><br/>This year launch of iPhone 7 is only for those geeks, unlike me, who actually stick to iPhone for life and for whom the price tag is just a symbol to flaunt.  Honestly, as most of the Apple users agree, what matters is the design of the phone.  If i see a person standing about 5 feet away from me with an iPhone 7 (not plus) and me holding my iPhone 6, a third person will obviously think we are using the same phone (not talking about brand).  So, if I were to shell Rs.60000 for a phone which retains the same design crafted with precision for three straight years, I better buy a device which satisfies me with its looks and performs as closely as an iPhone but loses the battle.  And with Rs.20000 cheaper.  I put my chips in there.  Unless you have to run tasks which need some significant power like Games, it's not worth an upgrade or a first time buy.l<br/><br/>I would request people to just think a bit before investing your hard earned money to go for iPhone 7.  Join the line in which I am standing for the \"revolutionary\" design of an iPhone 8 in 2017.  Because, that's when Apple is gonna show again to the world that they are masters of innovation.<br/><br/>All the best!</span>\n",

       " <span>The iPhone 7's notable camera, battery and water resistance improvements are a worthwhile upgrades to a familiar phone design, but ask yourself if you really need an upgrade...and if the Plus might be a better choice.<br/><br/>  GOOD SIDEs  (+)<br/>______________<br/># Improved cameras very well,<br/># The front with 7 MP camera is giving you really good pictures.<br/># Even the back shooter also is a very good camera.<br/># Beautiful design<br/># Screen and battery life is also improved<br/># Water resistance<br/># Tap-tic engine feedback is neat<br/># Powerful dual speakers<br/># Starts at 32GB, finally<br/># Ios 10, it actually really works well with the hardware of the phone.

Giving apple A10 fusion chip, which is 40% faster than previous, as well as 50% faster graphics.<br/><br/># FLASH DRIVE.... If you are worried about storage, then, SanDisk offering \"iXpand\" Flash drive upto 128 gb at 8500/- Rs.<br/>product link  &gt;<br/>((  http://www.amazon.in/SanDisk-iXpand-Flash-iPhones-Computers/dp/B01F6RWV94/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1499795607&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=external%2Bdrive%2Bfor%2Biphone&amp;th=1  ))<br/><br/># WATER &amp; DUST RESISTANCE.... Now the iPhone 7 has IP67 water resistance, no need to worry about the water under 15 cm.<br/><br/># CAMERAS..... We have some great cameras on iPhone 7 or 7 plus. Now iPhone 7 has optical stabilization, which something we didn't having in previous iPhone, also get 1.8 aperture. And 7 MP front facing camera which will give decent photos, also 1080p video recording from front.<br/><br/>#STEREO SPEAKERS.....  This time around we don't have 1 speaker, we have 2 speakers, one at the top and one at the bottom. they are very loud, which is really need.<br/><br/># COLOR... Now iPhone comes with beautiful jet black and matte black. You will fall in love with the phone.<br/><br/> Reasons NOT To Buy The iPhone 7<br/>_____________________________<br/># DESIGN.... Apple making almost same design from so many generation. Its nice to having something nice, some thing new. all other competitors are trying for something new.<br/><br/># CAMERA BUMP..... The camera bump looks ugly, If apple had make the device a little bit thicker, there would be no camera bump, and you have the space for BIGGER BATTERY, which will made big deference. It have longer life battery because of optimization of new processor.<br/><br/># BATTERY..... We still don't have the fast charging or wireless charging. Now wireless charging  i get not everybody use this, But fast charger we really need for this. Yes we have fast charger with iPad, but we need fast charger along the iPhone itself, which will charge faster.<br/><br/># HEAD PHONE JACK..... This is a too much of big a deal, Yes they are giving lightning converter, but if you listening something to your headphone wide, working on your phone, and you need to charge, that will be big issue.<br/><br/># MICRO SD CARD SLOT.... Specially i really miss the absence of Micro SD card slot. I think every body is. We really need micro SD slot on iPhone for more space option. But yeah this option will little bit slow down to iPhone performance.<br/><br/># CUSTOMIZABILITY ON IOS.... If you are a person that really like to customize your phone, then ios is definitely not for you.<br/><br/>So that is it. Thank You.<br/>I THINK IT WILL HELP YOU.<br/>Thank you Amazon India</span>\n",

       " <span>Overview - On the outside, the new iPhone looks basically the same as the iPhone 6/6s. They are now water resistant, which is nice, although they’re not fully waterproof, keep them submerged in a meter of water for more than 30 minutes and things might not go your way.<br/><br/>Once you wrap your head around the missing audio jack (it's not the end of it, you can get a designated adapter for your favorite headphones), the Apple iPhone 7 is a major upgrade. IP67-certified water-resistant body. Bigger and brighter camera with OIS. New FaceTime cam. Stereo speakers. Faster processor and 50% GPU performance increase, more RAM. New pressure-sensitive Home key powered by a new taptic engine. Revised storage options.<br/><br/>Battery - iPhone 7 is powered with the newest A10 Fusion chip. It is a quad core processor which helps in better managing the battery life. It takes around 2hrs to completely charge from 0-100% and the battery usually lasts a day. I am a heavy user, and use the phone quite a lot during the day. Whatsapp, Twitter, Calling and Messaging are the main battery draining apps for me. I will be left with 20-25% battery at the end of the day with typical usage.<br/><br/>Performance - Apple made the best mobile chipset from which others can only learn from. Its dual-core processor, even without the help of the tiny energy efficient cores, beats any other processor out there. The A10 GPU is equally impressive acing every graphic benchmark. The iPhone 7 is the fastest and most powerful smartphone in the world as of now.<br/><br/>Audio - iPhone 7 has stereo speakers, considering my previous iPhone was the 5s, it is a huge upgrade for me in the audio performance. Loudspeaker is pretty good, audio output is loud and clear. Call quality is damn good.<br/><br/>Camera - The colors and contrast are great and the dynamic range is simply great - much like you would get on dedicated big cameras. In any case, the iPhone 7 delivers the most balanced dynamic range from any smartphone at the moment. The optical image stabilization is the addition that really matters as it will keep the lens steady and won't allow for blurry shots at low-light. The front-facing camera got its resolution boosted to 7MP and records 1080p video. It can use Retina flash, where your screen lights up in different colors depending on the intended white balance of the scene. Pretty good when taking selfies in dark environment. Coming to the 4k video recording, it is the best camera when it comes to 4k Video, Period.<br/><br/>Overall a great package and the phone will definitely last 3+ years if used carefully. There won't be any performance issues considering Apple will provide updates regularly and the phone won't lag after using it for a year or so unlike the android phones. The phone is also water and dust resistant, if we accidentally end up dropping the phone in water, there is no need to worry. The phone can even be used to take pictures in swimming pool and shallow water(Be careful with the depth of water else phone will be toast). Putting a case and a screen protector will ruin the beauty of phone and the phone won't feel the same, but if you are the one who drops the phone constantly then Case and Screen protectors are necessary evils. I got it for a price of 36500/- in the Great Indian Sale :p<br/><br/>Absolutely Loving it !!</span>\n",

       " <span>I got the delivery of this phone on December 30th. I bought an iphone 7 specifically because of the button when I broke my old 6S.<br/><br/>Since the day I bought this phone, it had been showing battery drain and overheating. I thought it would be due to the intense icloud downloads that the phone was doing in the background. Ever since day 1, the phone wouldn't receive calls or can make calls. I thought it would be a network issue.<br/><br/>I tried doing a return after 2 days noticing the phone's not showing any signs of proper useability without a charger at hand at all times. But Amazon would not allow me to return it saying contact Apple support. Now apple support was on Holidays till 3rd of January.<br/><br/>Finally when I got to Apple support, they have done a diagnostic and couldn't find anything unusual, but asked me to observe for 3 more days. 3 more days, I contacted Apple for them to tell me to take it to a service center. Still cannot make phone calls or receive them. I tried returning through multiple different options, which all led me back to amazon responding saying contact apple support.<br/><br/> I went to the Vodafone store to confirm if I had any network issues, only for them to find out, no matter which sim they put in my phone, it will not make or receive phone calls.<br/><br/>So I went to the service centre for them to keep my phone under observation for another 5 days. And they acknowledged the phone's showing temperature and battery drain, but since Apple diagnosis isn't showing any issues, they asked me to continue using the phone for another 1-2 weeks.<br/><br/>Now, as they did restore the phone, I tried coming back home with my sim card, only to see, the same issue, that I cannot make phone calls or receive them. I can send/receive text messages. I contacted Apple support again, for them to acknowledge now that there is an issue and I have to send it for service.<br/><br/>Now as the return period is conveniently over, Amazon refuses to do anything to take the faulty product back. I have wasted 2 weeks of time and energy running around trying to get this phone fixed, only to waste another week or two for the phone to go out and get repaired and come back.<br/><br/>Amazon has responded asking me to get a \"service denied letter\" from Apple support for them to refund and take return of this product that I have wasted 2 weeks on.<br/><br/>So, long story short, go buy it from a local store. You buy it from Amazon, be prepared to chase tails and run around like headless chicken to sort out any issue you're facing. Worse, if you're in a place with no local authorised apple service centre.</span>\n",

       "<span>Build and Design: 8/10<br/>The iPhone 7 Plus does not come with a drastically new design. You can look at it more of adding finesse to the iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6s Plus designs. The similar design is now in its third generation. Is Apple holding out till next year, to release a brand new design language? Not that it is bad in the current state, but it dosen’t make it stand out from its predecessors. Not to mention, the designs from its Android arch-rivals has certainly seen changes over the years.The first thing that you will notice when you handle the phone, is that the visible antenna lines have been nicely camouflaged. While it is still visible to an extent on the Rose Gold, Silver and Gold variants of the phone; on the Matte Black and Jet Black versions, you have to really look for it.The rounded edges, power / standby, volume rocker buttons and the ringer notch are all in the same spot as the iPhone 6s Plus. So is the home button. But there’s a catch. The circular button isn’t a push button anymore but is supported by the Taptic Engine’s feedback mechanism. The Taptic Engine which supports the 3D touch mechanism for the display, also controls the touch response on the button. You can set the levels of feedback for the button, and honestly after a while you forget that the button isn’t there. It is one cool implementation. And it is such fine design details that make Apple products what they are.The edges are 7.3mm thick and it weighs around 188 grams. While the thickness is the same as its predecessor, it is around 4 grams lighter. In terms of overall feel of the phone and sturdiness, there isn’t much different from the iPhone 6s Plus. And the complaint we had with the 6s Plus remains. The iPhone 7 Plus offers a terrible body to screen ratio as compared to some of its Android flagships such as the Galaxy S7 edge or the newly launched Google Pixel XL, which offers 5.5-inch display in a more compact body.The rear side has a bump in the top left hand corner which houses two 12MP camera sensors. Snapping on cover on the iPhone brings the camera bump with the plane of the iPhone back.There is one important addition though. It is IP67 certified which makes it water and dust resistant.Metal back is still as slippery as its predecessors. Apple has some really cool leather covers with metallic button areas if you have buttery hands. They sell separately, of course. Snapping them on further reduces ease of one-handed use. And no, you cannot use the last generation covers on this phone for obvious reasons. I got the matte black variant to review, and it looks quite wonderful, as compared to the other three colours. The Jet Black variant is still the more premium variant, and I would not be surprised if we see more Jet black or piano black phone colours over the coming months.<br/><br/>Features: 8.5/10<br/>Thanks to a limited product portfolio in its smartphone segment, Apple really ensures that the internals get a good amount of upgrade in the coming generations. To that extent, the iPhone 7 Plus comes with the Apple A10 Fusion chipset which has a quad-core processor clocked at 2.23GHz. This is paired with 3GB RAM. It comes with a 5.5-inch Full HD resolution display.There are three storage variants – 32GB, 128GB and 256GB of which we have the 256GB variant for review. There is no expandable storage.<br/><br/>It runs on iOS 10. A single nano SIM card slot is present on the right hand side, just below the power/standby button. It supports dual band Wi-Fi 802.11 ac, Wi-fi hotspot, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS with A-GPS and GLONASS, NFC only for Apply Pay which is not available in India. And also, no FM radio.The big changes on the features front is the dropping of the 3.5mm audio jack. You will need a lightning port connector on your earphones. Apple bundles a pair. Other option is using a Bluetooth headset to enjoy your music. Apple has also bundled in a lightning port to 3.5 mm audio jack adapter for those who still want to rely on their personal audio gear. This is one move that drew a lot of flak as a lot of us still prefer using personal earphones / headphones which still have a 3.5mm jack. But give it some time and you will see a lot more lightning port earphone accessories, going by Apple’s history of spawning off accessories market segments. The iPhone 7 Plus comes with stereo speakers finally, with one being at the base and the other on the earpiece speaker.<br/><br/>On the camera front, you get two 12MP sensors on the back and there is a 7MP front-facing FaceTime HD camera. Apple has implemented the dual rear cameras in a way that you get to use true 2x optical zoom.<br/><br/>Display: 8/10<br/>The iPhone 7 Plus sports a 5.5inch FullHD display which gives a pixel density of 401PPI. The panel is an LED backlit IPS LCD panel. However with the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple claims to be using a wide gamut display (cinema standard). When placed side by side with the iPhone 6s/6s Plus, I noticed that the iPhone 7 Plus had a slight warm tinge to it. The iPhone 7 Plus is definitely a notch brighter than the 6s Plus. The Night Shift mode lets you select the time when you want to display to control the blue light, and it also lets you select the shade of yellow that you are comfortable with. This added granularity is a nice touch.<br/><br/>Colour reproduction is spot on and it is still a class-leading display among smartphones. Colours aren’t unnecessarily vivid. Legibility in sunlight is not an issue, as its auto-brightness mode works quite well. The display, as has been the case with previous generations, is quite glossy. It was while shooting in bright sunlight where at times all I could see on the display was my reflection, specially when shooting from chest height. Not so much at the eye level.<br/><br/>The black levels on the display are quite good and watching movies or playing games is a lot of fun. Games such as Vain Glory, Real Racing 3, Nova 3 look gorgeous on this calibrated display.<br/><br/>Software: 8/10<br/>Apple iPhone 7 Plus comes with the latest iOS 10 operating system. The one running on the review unit was 10.0.3 on which majority of the testing was done, before switching to the 10.1 beta to access the Portrait mode in the Camera app. The iOS 10 is refined and operationally quite smooth on most occasions. There were a few instances of apps not registering action on first tap.<br/><br/>iOS 10 dosen’t look very different from its predecessor, but packs in a lot of new features. For starters, you can now uninstall the native Apple apps if you don’t need them. I figured I would do without Stocks, Home and a couple of other apps which I deleted. Technically it just hides the icon and deletes all the app data from your phone. You can reinstall the app by searching for it in the App store.<br/><br/>The 3D touch still offers the Peek and Pop features, with support added to a lot more apps than we had seen when the 6s Plus launched.<br/><br/>Messages has got a complete revamp with the app letting you add in GIF animations; finger gestures –  creating animations such as heart break, beating heart and more; send photos from the camera while in the app; share music and so on. While these additions are playing catch up to the likes of apps such as Telegram, it makes little sense to use Messages if your family or friend circle isn’t on Apple devices.Control Centre has been modified, with the music control shifted to a new tab. Also the four icons at the base – torch, timer, calculator and camera support 3D gestures, letting you access more functions without leaving the Control Centre screen. iOS 10 also lets you do a lot from the lock screen itself. You can swipe left to open the camera or swipe right to access widgets or swipe from the top to bottom to see notifications. There’s also the ‘Raise to Wake up’ feature which wakes up the display when you just lift your iPhone to your face if its lying in the sleep mode on your desk.Music app has got some design changes. Instead of My Music, you now get a Library tab which lets you enlist a variety of options from Playlists, Artists, Album, Songs and so on. You can download songs if you are a subscriber, optimise storage by setting a limit on auto downloads, auto-generated playlists in the ‘For You’ section and more.<br/><br/>The Photos app has got some additions in the form of Memories, where in iOS makes albums based on your photos shot at a particular location. In short, this is Apple Photos playing catch up to Google Photos, which has much more interesting features.Siri was the star feature of the iPhones when it was first announced back in 2011. Since then Google has been getting better with its AI-backed virtual assistant game – first Google Now and this year the Google Assistant. Between the two, we noticed that the Assistant was able to understand accents better and let you have contextual conversations, whereas with Siri you still have to pay attention to your diction.Even asking Siri simple questions such as “what was the iPhone 7 Plus pricing for India” or “when was Siri released?” the responses weren’t very forth coming. Also between the two I also realised that most of the times you have to ask Siri questions in a particular way, and you cannot ask follow up questions and get satisfactory responses as you do with Assistant. Apple says Siri is a self-learning system, so maybe it needs more usage. But after using it for a week, it isn’t significantly better than Google Assistant. One thing I would grant Siri is the way it presents card information – is much more richer and informative than Google.<br/><br/>Performance: 9/10<br/>Call quality is top notch with audible earpiece speaker even in high traffic situations. The iPhone 7 Plus supports Cat 9 LTE, voice over LTE, Wi-fi calling. I did not find any connectivity issues with a Jio SIM card on it, and was able to make successful VoLTE calls.With the latest Apple A10 Fusion chipset paired with 3GB of RAM (the highest seen on an Apple iPhone) you get a wicked fast device. The A10 Fusion chipset houses a quad-core processor, with two high power cores clocked at 2.23GHz and two low power saving ones. There’s a six-core GPU as well. The single core performance score of 3445 observed on GeekBench 4 was the highest we have seen on any smartphone we have tested so far. Even the multi-core score is only second to Huawei P9. The AnTuTu benchmark gives 186093 – again the highest score.<br/><br/>In terms of raw numbers, the iPhone 7 Plus comes out tops. In real life usage though, the phone runs lag free and things such as app switching, finger print scanning work fast. The phone does get warm when you are on a particularly photography heavy day, but never crossing 36-38 degree mark on the Fluke IR thermometer.<br/><br/>Gaming on the phone is smooth. No frame drops were observed on high end games such Vain Glory, Nova 3, Real Racing 3 and so on. Watching movies with the stereo speakers is quite a fine experience. The speakers are quite loud, but in certain applications such as YouTube, we observed that using the headphones was a battery option.<br/><br/>Camera: 8.5/10<br/>One of the highlight feature of the iPhone 7 Plus is the presence of the dual rear camera setup. Sure, this isn’t the first time we are seeing a dual camera on a smartphone. Huawei and LG have done this before. But just like all things Apple, the implementation is different. There are two 12MP sensors, one is standard camera which has an equivalent focal length of 28mm (with an f/1.8 aperture) and the other sensor has a telephoto lens having a 56mm focal length (with an f/2.8 aperture). The standard 28mm lens comes with OIS, whereas the telephoto lens does not. This implementation lets the iPhone 7 Plus offer true 2x optical zoom. The Camera app lets you easily switch regular wide angle shot and the 2x optical zoom shot. This ensures that there is no loss in detail when taking 2x zoom photos.While it may seem like they are two different cameras, they do tend to work together everytime you fire off the shutter. You can use these two lenses when shooting videos as well, but switching to the 2x zoom, will remove the OIS feature. The two lenses work quite well in the Portrait mode which is currently available on the iOS 10.1 beta. Also another thing to note is that the telephoto lens can only be used in well lit situations, and if the light isn’t enough, the iPhone 7 Plus will use the regular lens with 2x digital zoom. Apple’s image processor takes this decision on the fly.<br/><br/>The iPhone 7 Plus has a 7MP front facing FaceTime HD camera and quad LED flash unit on the rear side. Features carried forward from the iPhone 6s Plus include the live photos, phase detect autofocus. The Camera app is also similar to the one seen in the last generation.<br/><br/>Coming to the image quality, the iPhone 7 Plus just like its predecessors, delivers. Colours come out natural and at times it may look a bit too dull when compared with images coming out of say a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge or even the latest Google Pixel XL. Apple iPhone 7 Plus gives a neutral output, with good amount of detail, great dynamic range. Optical zoom works quite well in bright outdoors. You also get the option of using 10x digital zoom for still images and 6x digital zoom for video. Use this only in emergency situations as there is a lot of artifacts you will get in the final images. When forcing the HDR mode, we also noticed some artifacts around the edges if the subject moved too much, as is seen in the fur of the labrador in the image below, around the right paw.Panoramas come out really good, and there is good exposure control. You can also get HDR Panorama shots with the new camera app. There were instances when shooting panoramas in bright sunlight, where I noticed mild change in the sky exposure. But the image stitching is relatively better than that seen on Android phones. The 2x optical zoom also offers Panorama mode.Focussing is relatively quick. But time to first shot is still slow as compared to the quicker ways in which you can turn on cameras in some Android phones. Double tapping the home button to launch the camera is really a no brainer which Apple should implement.Low light image quality is good, but in a side by side comparison with the Google Pixel XL, I noticed that the Pixel XL clearly took the lead there. I’m not saying iPhone 7 Plus is a bad camera in low light – far from it. But the noise control, detail retention, dynamic range seen on the Galaxy S7 and Pixel XL is notches above the iPhone 7 Plus.The Portrait mode was one area which Apple spoke about a lot during the launch. During the time of testing it was only available on the beta, though it is now available to everyone. Once you turn on the Portrait mode, you will get instructions below the rounded square frame, whether you need to move closer or farther. Once you get the lock, the focussing frame becomes yellow and you fire the shutter. Images clicked in the portrait mode turned out good, it works specially well when you are in a well lit area and there is respectable distance between the subject and the background. The blurring of the background is nicely done and isn’t as aggressive as what we have seen with other dual camera phones. The good thing is that you can see the shallow depth of field while you are composing the shot. But the problem is that it will take some practise to get the shot faster. Your subject will have to really be patient till you get everything right. This may be cool when shooting friends and family, but if you are on the street and want to get that quick portrait with a defocussed background, then that can prove difficult.<br/><br/>On the video front, the iPhone 7 Plus can shoot up to 4K resolution videos. The OIS on the phone ensures that there is minimal camera shake, although you do see a slight jello effect when walking and shooting. The camera region does get warm when shooting videos. But not enough to cause it to shut down, as I have observed with Sony flagship smartphones.<br/><br/>Battery Life: 8/10<br/>Coming with a 2900mAh non-removable battery, the iPhone 7 Plus has seen a bump in this department as compared to the previous generation. In a word, the battery life is excellent. There wasn’t a day in the two weeks that I was using the phone, when I found the battery to be draining out before my work day. In fact, with a 100 percent charge at 8AM, and after a day of regular usage, I would still have around 20 percent charge remaining till around 10PM. Heavy usage including playing games, streaming video, calling, messaging via multiple apps, using the camera extensively did drain out the battery by around 9PM. The battery usage numbers show some really good numbers with a 16 hour plus usage time and standby time of over 40 hours. It also offers the Low Power mode, which further extends the battery.Charging seems to take forever though. It easily takes over 3 hours to go from sub-10 percent to 100 percent charge. In an age of rapid charging technologies available on all Android flagships, where you can go from 0 to 100 in just over an hour’s time, Apple’s charging technology seems dated. The good thing is that the iPhone 7 Plus can hold the charge for that much longer vis-a-vis an Android phone. But it’s about time Apple get some sort of quick charging onboard. Is it holding that out for the 10th anniversary edition?<br/><br/>Verdict and Price in India<br/>All things considered, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus is a great device. It excels in departments such as battery life, performance, display among other things. The iOS 10 also brings a lot of new features to the table. The implementation of the dual rear camera is quite intelligent. Also portrait mode will be quite loved by those who love that kind of photography – it will just require patience though. While the camera image quality is good, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus still leaves scope for improvement in the low light photography department as we observed in out Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus shootout.<br/><br/>If you are on the iPhone 6/6 Plus and are looking for an upgrade, the iPhone 7/7 Plus could be considered. For the 6s / 6s Plus users, there is little to no reason for upgrade. You would rather wait out this iteration for the 10th year iPhone edition.<br/><br/>While the iPhone 7 Plus is good, it looks like Apple is leaving the better things for its 10th year edition. Things such as similar design, no quick charging support, similar camera app (which still makes you dig into the General settings to make tweaks in resolution and the like) among other areas have been carried forward from previous two generations. There’s a high possibility that some of these issues would hopefully be addressed in the next gen iPhone.<br/><br/>Prices start from Rs 72,000 for 32GB, Rs 82,000 for 128GB and Rs 92,000 for the 256GB variant of the iPhone 7 Plus. The prices are high, and yes you can get a lot more in that amount. But if you want to invest in an iPhone, this is what you have to pay. A lot of telcos are offering the iPhone 7/7 Plus with various data packs as compared to Android competition. Thankfully, the pricing is in line with what it was last year. If 5.5-inch is too large a size for you, then opt for the iPhone 7 which still retains most of the internal features seen on the iPhone 7 Plus.<br/><br/>If you are still not convinced about the iPhone 7 Plus, or are short on budget, the Android flagships that you can consider include the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge which is still a powerful device. I have been testing the Google Pixel XL for some days now, and it has already shown its capability in the low light department as compared to the iPhone 7 Plus. So that could also be a possible contender.</span>\n",

       "'\\nBuild and Design: 8/10The iPhone 7 Plus does not come with a drastically new design. You can look at it more of adding finesse to the iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6s Plus designs. The similar design is now in its third generation. Is Apple holding out till next year, to release a brand new design language? Not that it is bad in the current state, but it dosen’t make it stand out from its predecessors. Not to mention, the designs from its Android arch-rivals has certainly seen changes over the years.The first thing that you will notice when you handle the phone, is that the visible antenna lines have been nicely camouflaged. While it is still visible to an extent on the Rose Gold, Silver and Gold variants of the phone; on the Matte Black and Jet Black versions, you have to really look for it.The rounded edges, power / standby, volume rocker buttons and the ringer notch are all in the same spot as the iPhone 6s Plus. So is the home button. But there’s a catch. The circular button isn’t a push button anymore but is supported by the Taptic Engine’s feedback mechanism. The Taptic Engine which supports the 3D touch mechanism for the display, also controls the touch response on the button. You can set the levels of feedback for the button, and honestly after a while you forget that the button isn’t there. It is one cool implementation. And it is such fine design details that make Apple products what they are.The edges are 7.3mm thick and it weighs around 188 grams. While the thickness is the same as its predecessor, it is around 4 grams lighter. In terms of overall feel of the phone and sturdiness, there isn’t much different from the iPhone 6s Plus. And the complaint we had with the 6s Plus remains. The iPhone 7 Plus offers a terrible body to screen ratio as compared to some of its Android flagships such as the Galaxy S7 edge or the newly launched Google Pixel XL, which offers 5.5-inch display in a more compact body.The rear side has a bump in the top left hand corner which houses two 12MP camera sensors. Snapping on cover on the iPhone brings the camera bump with the plane of the iPhone back.There is one important addition though. It is IP67 certified which makes it water and dust resistant.Metal back is still as slippery as its predecessors. Apple has some really cool leather covers with metallic button areas if you have buttery hands. They sell separately, of course. Snapping them on further reduces ease of one-handed use. And no, you cannot use the last generation covers on this phone for obvious reasons. I got the matte black variant to review, and it looks quite wonderful, as compared to the other three colours. The Jet Black variant is still the more premium variant, and I would not be surprised if we see more Jet black or piano black phone colours over the coming months.Features: 8.5/10Thanks to a limited product portfolio in its smartphone segment, Apple really ensures that the internals get a good amount of upgrade in the coming generations. To that extent, the iPhone 7 Plus comes with the Apple A10 Fusion chipset which has a quad-core processor clocked at 2.23GHz. This is paired with 3GB RAM. It comes with a 5.5-inch Full HD resolution display.There are three storage variants – 32GB, 128GB and 256GB of which we have the 256GB variant for review. There is no expandable storage.It runs on iOS 10. A single nano SIM card slot is present on the right hand side, just below the power/standby button. It supports dual band Wi-Fi 802.11 ac, Wi-fi hotspot, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS with A-GPS and GLONASS, NFC only for Apply Pay which is not available in India. And also, no FM radio.The big changes on the features front is the dropping of the 3.5mm audio jack. You will need a lightning port connector on your earphones. Apple bundles a pair. Other option is using a Bluetooth headset to enjoy your music. Apple has also bundled in a lightning port to 3.5 mm audio jack adapter for those who still want to rely on their personal audio gear. This is one move that drew a lot of flak as a lot of us still prefer using personal earphones / headphones which still have a 3.5mm jack. But give it some time and you will see a lot more lightning port earphone accessories, going by Apple’s history of spawning off accessories market segments. The iPhone 7 Plus comes with stereo speakers finally, with one being at the base and the other on the earpiece speaker.On the camera front, you get two 12MP sensors on the back and there is a 7MP front-facing FaceTime HD camera. Apple has implemented the dual rear cameras in a way that you get to use true 2x optical zoom.Display: 8/10The iPhone 7 Plus sports a 5.5inch FullHD display which gives a pixel density of 401PPI. The panel is an LED backlit IPS LCD panel. However with the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple claims to be using a wide gamut display (cinema standard). When placed side by side with the iPhone 6s/6s Plus, I noticed that the iPhone 7 Plus had a slight warm tinge to it. The iPhone 7 Plus is definitely a notch brighter than the 6s Plus. The Night Shift mode lets you select the time when you want to display to control the blue light, and it also lets you select the shade of yellow that you are comfortable with. This added granularity is a nice touch.Colour reproduction is spot on and it is still a class-leading display among smartphones. Colours aren’t unnecessarily vivid. Legibility in sunlight is not an issue, as its auto-brightness mode works quite well. The display, as has been the case with previous generations, is quite glossy. It was while shooting in bright sunlight where at times all I could see on the display was my reflection, specially when shooting from chest height. Not so much at the eye level.The black levels on the display are quite good and watching movies or playing games is a lot of fun. Games such as Vain Glory, Real Racing 3, Nova 3 look gorgeous on this calibrated display.Software: 8/10Apple iPhone 7 Plus comes with the latest iOS 10 operating system. The one running on the review unit was 10.0.3 on which majority of the testing was done, before switching to the 10.1 beta to access the Portrait mode in the Camera app. The iOS 10 is refined and operationally quite smooth on most occasions. There were a few instances of apps not registering action on first tap.iOS 10 dosen’t look very different from its predecessor, but packs in a lot of new features. For starters, you can now uninstall the native Apple apps if you don’t need them. I figured I would do without Stocks, Home and a couple of other apps which I deleted. Technically it just hides the icon and deletes all the app data from your phone. You can reinstall the app by searching for it in the App store.The 3D touch still offers the Peek and Pop features, with support added to a lot more apps than we had seen when the 6s Plus launched.Messages has got a complete revamp with the app letting you add in GIF animations; finger gestures –  creating animations such as heart break, beating heart and more; send photos from the camera while in the app; share music and so on. While these additions are playing catch up to the likes of apps such as Telegram, it makes little sense to use Messages if your family or friend circle isn’t on Apple devices.Control Centre has been modified, with the music control shifted to a new tab. Also the four icons at the base – torch, timer, calculator and camera support 3D gestures, letting you access more functions without leaving the Control Centre screen. iOS 10 also lets you do a lot from the lock screen itself. You can swipe left to open the camera or swipe right to access widgets or swipe from the top to bottom to see notifications. There’s also the ‘Raise to Wake up’ feature which wakes up the display when you just lift your iPhone to your face if its lying in the sleep mode on your desk.Music app has got some design changes. Instead of My Music, you now get a Library tab which lets you enlist a variety of options from Playlists, Artists, Album, Songs and so on. You can download songs if you are a subscriber, optimise storage by setting a limit on auto downloads, auto-generated playlists in the ‘For You’ section and more.The Photos app has got some additions in the form of Memories, where in iOS makes albums based on your photos shot at a particular location. In short, this is Apple Photos playing catch up to Google Photos, which has much more interesting features.Siri was the star feature of the iPhones when it was first announced back in 2011. Since then Google has been getting better with its AI-backed virtual assistant game – first Google Now and this year the Google Assistant. Between the two, we noticed that the Assistant was able to understand accents better and let you have contextual conversations, whereas with Siri you still have to pay attention to your diction.Even asking Siri simple questions such as “what was the iPhone 7 Plus pricing for India” or “when was Siri released?” the responses weren’t very forth coming.

In real life usage though, the phone runs lag free and things such as app switching, finger print scanning work fast. The phone does get warm when you are on a particularly photography heavy day, but never crossing 36-38 degree mark on the Fluke IR thermometer.Gaming on the phone is smooth. No frame drops were observed on high end games such Vain Glory, Nova 3, Real Racing 3 and so on. Watching movies with the stereo speakers is quite a fine experience.

The standard 28mm lens comes with OIS, whereas the telephoto lens does not. This implementation lets the iPhone 7 Plus offer true 2x optical zoom. The Camera app lets you easily switch regular wide angle shot and the 2x optical zoom shot. This ensures that there is no loss in detail when taking 2x zoom photos.While it may seem like they are two different cameras, they do tend to work together everytime you fire off the shutter. You can use these two lenses when shooting videos as well, but switching to the 2x zoom, will remove the OIS feature. The two lenses work quite well in the Portrait mode which is currently available on the iOS 10.1 beta. Also another thing to note is that the telephoto lens can only be used in well lit situations, and if the light isn’t enough, the iPhone 7 Plus will use the regular lens with 2x digital zoom. Apple’s image processor takes this decision on the fly.The iPhone 7 Plus has a 7MP front facing FaceTime HD camera and quad LED flash unit on the rear side. Features carried forward from the iPhone 6s Plus include the live photos, phase detect autofocus. The Camera app is also similar to the one seen in the last generation.Coming to the image quality, the iPhone 7 Plus just like its predecessors, delivers. Colours come out natural and at times it may look a bit too dull when compared with images coming out of say a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge or even the latest Google Pixel XL. Apple iPhone 7 Plus gives a neutral output, with good amount of detail, great dynamic range. Optical zoom works quite well in bright outdoors. You also get the option of using 10x digital zoom for still images and 6x digital zoom for video. Use this only in emergency situations as there is a lot of artifacts you will get in the final images. When forcing the HDR mode, we also noticed some artifacts around the edges if the subject moved too much, as is seen in the fur of the labrador in the image below, around the right paw.Panoramas come out really good, and there is good exposure control. You can also get HDR Panorama shots with the new camera app. There were instances when shooting panoramas in bright sunlight, where I noticed mild change in the sky exposure. But the image stitching is relatively better than that seen on Android phones. The 2x optical zoom also offers Panorama mode.Focussing is relatively quick. But time to first shot is still slow as compared to the quicker ways in which you can turn on cameras in some Android phones. Double tapping the home button to launch the camera is really a no brainer which Apple should implement.Low light image quality is good, but in a side by side comparison with the Google Pixel XL, I noticed that the Pixel XL clearly took the lead there. I’m not saying iPhone 7 Plus is a bad camera in low light – far from it. But the noise control, detail retention, dynamic range seen on the Galaxy S7 and Pixel XL is notches above the iPhone 7 Plus.The Portrait mode was one area which Apple spoke about a lot during the launch. During the time of testing it was only available on the beta, though it is now available to everyone. Once you turn on the Portrait mode, you will get instructions below the rounded square frame, whether you need to move closer or farther. Once you get the lock, the focussing frame becomes yellow and you fire the shutter. Images clicked in the portrait mode turned out good, it works specially well when you are in a well lit area and there is respectable distance between the subject and the background. The blurring of the background is nicely done and isn’t as aggressive as what we have seen with other dual camera phones. The good thing is that you can see the shallow depth of field while you are composing the shot. But the problem is that it will take some practise to get the shot faster. Your subject will have to really be patient till you get everything right. This may be cool when shooting friends and family, but if you are on the street and want to get that quick portrait with a defocussed background, then that can prove difficult.On the video front, the iPhone 7 Plus can shoot up to 4K resolution videos. The OIS on the phone ensures that there is minimal camera shake, although you do see a slight jello effect when walking and shooting. The camera region does get warm when shooting videos. But not enough to cause it to shut down, as I have observed with Sony flagship smartphones.Battery Life: 8/10Coming with a 2900mAh non-removable battery, the iPhone 7 Plus has seen a bump in this department as compared to the previous generation. In a word, the battery life is excellent. There wasn’t a day in the two weeks that I was using the phone, when I found the battery to be draining out before my work day. In fact, with a 100 percent charge at 8AM, and after a day of regular usage, I would still have around 20 percent charge remaining till around 10PM. Heavy usage including playing games, streaming video, calling, messaging via multiple apps, using the camera extensively did drain out the battery by around 9PM. The battery usage numbers show some really good numbers with a 16 hour plus usage time and standby time of over 40 hours. It also offers the Low Power mode, which further extends the battery.Charging seems to take forever though. It easily takes over 3 hours to go from sub-10 percent to 100 percent charge. In an age of rapid charging technologies available on all Android flagships, where you can go from 0 to 100 in just over an hour’s time, Apple’s charging technology seems dated. The good thing is that the iPhone 7 Plus can hold the charge for that much longer vis-a-vis an Android phone. But it’s about time Apple get some sort of quick charging onboard. Is it holding that out for the 10th anniversary edition?Verdict and Price in IndiaAll things considered, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus is a great device. It excels in departments such as battery life, performance, display among other things. The iOS 10 also brings a lot of new features to the table. The implementation of the dual rear camera is quite intelligent. Also portrait mode will be quite loved by those who love that kind of photography – it will just require patience though. While the camera image quality is good, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus still leaves scope for improvement in the low light photography department as we observed in out Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus shootout.If you are on the iPhone 6/6 Plus and are looking for an upgrade, the iPhone 7/7 Plus could be considered. For the 6s / 6s Plus users, there is little to no reason for upgrade. You would rather wait out this iteration for the 10th year iPhone edition.While the iPhone 7 Plus is good, it looks like Apple is leaving the better things for its 10th year edition. Things such as similar design, no quick charging support, similar camera app (which still makes you dig into the General settings to make tweaks in resolution and the like) among other areas have been carried forward from previous two generations. There’s a high possibility that some of these issues would hopefully be addressed in the next gen iPhone.Prices start from Rs 72,000 for 32GB, Rs 82,000 for 128GB and Rs 92,000 for the 256GB variant of the iPhone 7 Plus. The prices are high, and yes you can get a lot more in that amount. But if you want to invest in an iPhone, this is what you have to pay. A lot of telcos are offering the iPhone 7/7 Plus with various data packs as compared to Android competition. Thankfully, the pricing is in line with what it was last year. If 5.5-inch is too large a size for you, then opt for the iPhone 7 which still retains most of the internal features seen on the iPhone 7 Plus.If you are still not convinced about the iPhone 7 Plus, or are short on budget, the Android flagships that you can consider include the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge which is still a powerful device. I have been testing the Google Pixel XL for some days now, and it has already shown its capability in the low light department as compared to the iPhone 7 Plus. So that could also be a possible contender.\\n'"

       "['\\nBuild and Design: 8/10The iPhone 7 Plus does not come with a drastically new design. You can look at it more of adding finesse to the iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6s Plus designs. The similar design is now in its third generation. Is Apple holding out till next year, to release a brand new design language? Not that it is bad in the current state, but it dosen’t make it stand out from its predecessors. Not to mention, the designs from its Android arch-rivals has certainly seen changes over the years.The first thing that you will notice when you handle the phone, is that the visible antenna lines have been nicely camouflaged. While it is still visible to an extent on the Rose Gold, Silver and Gold variants of the phone; on the Matte Black and Jet Black versions, you have to really look for it.The rounded edges, power / standby, volume rocker buttons and the ringer notch are all in the same spot as the iPhone 6s Plus. So is the home button. But there’s a catch. The circular button isn’t a push button anymore but is supported by the Taptic Engine’s feedback mechanism. The Taptic Engine which supports the 3D touch mechanism for the display, also controls the touch response on the button. You can set the levels of feedback for the button, and honestly after a while you forget that the button isn’t there. It is one cool implementation. And it is such fine design details that make Apple products what they are.The edges are 7.3mm thick and it weighs around 188 grams. While the thickness is the same as its predecessor, it is around 4 grams lighter. In terms of overall feel of the phone and sturdiness, there isn’t much different from the iPhone 6s Plus. And the complaint we had with the 6s Plus remains. The iPhone 7 Plus offers a terrible body to screen ratio as compared to some of its Android flagships such as the Galaxy S7 edge or the newly launched Google Pixel XL, which offers 5.5-inch display in a more compact body.The rear side has a bump in the top left hand corner which houses two 12MP camera sensors. Snapping on cover on the iPhone brings the camera bump with the plane of the iPhone back.There is one important addition though. It is IP67 certified which makes it water and dust resistant.Metal back is still as slippery as its predecessors. Apple has some really cool leather covers with metallic button areas if you have buttery hands. They sell separately, of course. Snapping them on further reduces ease of one-handed use. And no, you cannot use the last generation covers on this phone for obvious reasons. I got the matte black variant to review, and it looks quite wonderful, as compared to the other three colours. The Jet Black variant is still the more premium variant, and I would not be surprised if we see more Jet black or piano black phone colours over the coming months.Features: 8.5/10Thanks to a limited product portfolio in its smartphone segment, Apple really ensures that the internals get a good amount of upgrade in the coming generations. To that extent, the iPhone 7 Plus comes with the Apple A10 Fusion chipset which has a quad-core processor clocked at 2.23GHz. This is paired with 3GB RAM. It comes with a 5.5-inch Full HD resolution display.There are three storage variants – 32GB, 128GB and 256GB of which we have the 256GB variant for review. There is no expandable storage.It runs on iOS 10. A single nano SIM card slot is present on the right hand side, just below the power/standby button. It supports dual band Wi-Fi 802.11 ac, Wi-fi hotspot, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS with A-GPS and GLONASS, NFC only for Apply Pay which is not available in India. And also, no FM radio.The big changes on the features front is the dropping of the 3.5mm audio jack. You will need a lightning port connector on your earphones. Apple bundles a pair. Other option is using a Bluetooth headset to enjoy your music. Apple has also bundled in a lightning port to 3.5 mm audio jack adapter for those who still want to rely on their personal audio gear. This is one move that drew a lot of flak as a lot of us still prefer using personal earphones / headphones which still have a 3.5mm jack. But give it some time and you will see a lot more lightning port earphone accessories, going by Apple’s history of spawning off accessories market segments. The iPhone 7 Plus comes with stereo speakers finally, with one being at the base and the other on the earpiece speaker.On the camera front, you get two 12MP sensors on the back and there is a 7MP front-facing FaceTime HD camera. Apple has implemented the dual rear cameras in a way that you get to use true 2x optical zoom.Display: 8/10The iPhone 7 Plus sports a 5.5inch FullHD display which gives a pixel density of 401PPI. The panel is an LED backlit IPS LCD panel. However with the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple claims to be using a wide gamut display (cinema standard). When placed side by side with the iPhone 6s/6s Plus, I noticed that the iPhone 7 Plus had a slight warm tinge to it. The iPhone 7 Plus is definitely a notch brighter than the 6s Plus. The Night Shift mode lets you select the time when you want to display to control the blue light, and it also lets you select the shade of yellow that you are comfortable with. This added granularity is a nice touch.Colour reproduction is spot on and it is still a class-leading display among smartphones. Colours aren’t unnecessarily vivid. Legibility in sunlight is not an issue, as its auto-brightness mode works quite well. The display, as has been the case with previous generations, is quite glossy. It was while shooting in bright sunlight where at times all I could see on the display was my reflection, specially when shooting from chest height. Not so much at the eye level.The black levels on the display are quite good and watching movies or playing games is a lot of fun. Games such as Vain Glory, Real Racing 3, Nova 3 look gorgeous on this calibrated display.Software: 8/10Apple iPhone 7 Plus comes with the latest iOS 10 operating system. The one running on the review unit was 10.0.3 on which majority of the testing was done, before switching to the 10.1 beta to access the Portrait mode in the Camera app. The iOS 10 is refined and operationally quite smooth on most occasions. There were a few instances of apps not registering action on first tap.iOS 10 dosen’t look very different from its predecessor, but packs in a lot of new features. For starters, you can now uninstall the native Apple apps if you don’t need them. I figured I would do without Stocks, Home and a couple of other apps which I deleted. Technically it just hides the icon and deletes all the app data from your phone. You can reinstall the app by searching for it in the App store.The 3D touch still offers the Peek and Pop features, with support added to a lot more apps than we had seen when the 6s Plus launched.Messages has got a complete revamp with the app letting you add in GIF animations; finger gestures –  creating animations such as heart break, beating heart and more; send photos from the camera while in the app; share music and so on. While these additions are playing catch up to the likes of apps such as Telegram, it makes little sense to use Messages if your family or friend circle isn’t on Apple devices.Control Centre has been modified, with the music control shifted to a new tab. Also the four icons at the base – torch, timer, calculator and camera support 3D gestures, letting you access more functions without leaving the Control Centre screen. iOS 10 also lets you do a lot from the lock screen itself. You can swipe left to open the camera or swipe right to access widgets or swipe from the top to bottom to see notifications. There’s also the ‘Raise to Wake up’ feature which wakes up the display when you just lift your iPhone to your face if its lying in the sleep mode on your desk.Music app has got some design changes. Instead of My Music, you now get a Library tab which lets you enlist a variety of options from Playlists, Artists, Album, Songs and so on. You can download songs if you are a subscriber, optimise storage by setting a limit on auto downloads, auto-generated playlists in the ‘For You’ section and more.The Photos app has got some additions in the form of Memories, where in iOS makes albums based on your photos shot at a particular location. In short, this is Apple Photos playing catch up to Google Photos, which has much more interesting features.Siri was the star feature of the iPhones when it was first announced back in 2011. Since then Google has been getting better with its AI-backed virtual assistant game – first Google Now and this year the Google Assistant. Between the two, we noticed that the Assistant was able to understand accents better and let you have contextual conversations, whereas with Siri you still have to pay attention to your diction.Even asking Siri simple questions such as “what was the iPhone 7 Plus pricing for India” or “when was Siri released?” the responses weren’t very forth coming. Also between the two I also realised that most of the times you have to ask Siri questions in a particular way, and you cannot ask follow up questions and get satisfactory responses as you do with Assistant. Apple says Siri is a self-learning system, so maybe it needs more usage. But after using it for a week, it isn’t significantly better than Google Assistant. One thing I would grant Siri is the way it presents card information – is much more richer and informative than Google.Performance: 9/10Call quality is top notch with audible earpiece speaker even in high traffic situations. The iPhone 7 Plus supports Cat 9 LTE, voice over LTE, Wi-fi calling. I did not find any connectivity issues with a Jio SIM card on it, and was able to make successful VoLTE calls.With the latest Apple A10 Fusion chipset paired with 3GB of RAM (the highest seen on an Apple iPhone) you get a wicked fast device. The A10 Fusion chipset houses a quad-core processor, with two high power cores clocked at 2.23GHz and two low power saving ones. There’s a six-core GPU as well. The single core performance score of 3445 observed on GeekBench 4 was the highest we have seen on any smartphone we have tested so far. Even the multi-core score is only second to Huawei P9. The AnTuTu benchmark gives 186093 – again the highest score.In terms of raw numbers, the iPhone 7 Plus comes out tops. In real life usage though, the phone runs lag free and things such as app switching, finger print scanning work fast. The phone does get warm when you are on a particularly photography heavy day, but never crossing 36-38 degree mark on the Fluke IR thermometer.Gaming on the phone is smooth. No frame drops were observed on high end games such Vain Glory, Nova 3, Real Racing 3 and so on. Watching movies with the stereo speakers is quite a fine experience. The speakers are quite loud, but in certain applications such as YouTube, we observed that using the headphones was a battery option.Camera: 8.5/10One of the highlight feature of the iPhone 7 Plus is the presence of the dual rear camera setup. Sure, this isn’t the first time we are seeing a dual camera on a smartphone. Huawei and LG have done this before. But just like all things Apple, the implementation is different. There are two 12MP sensors, one is standard camera which has an equivalent focal length of 28mm (with an f/1.8 aperture) and the other sensor has a telephoto lens having a 56mm focal length (with an f/2.8 aperture). The standard 28mm lens comes with OIS, whereas the telephoto lens does not. This implementation lets the iPhone 7 Plus offer true 2x optical zoom. The Camera app lets you easily switch regular wide angle shot and the 2x optical zoom shot. This ensures that there is no loss in detail when taking 2x zoom photos.While it may seem like they are two different cameras, they do tend to work together everytime you fire off the shutter. You can use these two lenses when shooting videos as well, but switching to the 2x zoom, will remove the OIS feature. The two lenses work quite well in the Portrait mode which is currently available on the iOS 10.1 beta. Also another thing to note is that the telephoto lens can only be used in well lit situations, and if the light isn’t enough, the iPhone 7 Plus will use the regular lens with 2x digital zoom. Apple’s image processor takes this decision on the fly.The iPhone 7 Plus has a 7MP front facing FaceTime HD camera and quad LED flash unit on the rear side. Features carried forward from the iPhone 6s Plus include the live photos, phase detect autofocus. The Camera app is also similar to the one seen in the last generation.Coming to the image quality, the iPhone 7 Plus just like its predecessors, delivers.

Apple iPhone 7 Plus gives a neutral output, with good amount of detail, great dynamic range. Optical zoom works quite well in bright outdoors. You also get the option of using 10x digital zoom for still images and 6x digital zoom for video. Use this only in emergency situations as there is a lot of artifacts you will get in the final images. When forcing the HDR mode, we also noticed some artifacts around the edges if the subject moved too much, as is seen in the fur of the labrador in the image below, around the right paw.Panoramas come out really good, and there is good exposure control. You can also get HDR Panorama shots with the new camera app. There were instances when shooting panoramas in bright sunlight, where I noticed mild change in the sky exposure. But the image stitching is relatively better than that seen on Android phones. The 2x optical zoom also offers Panorama mode.Focussing is relatively quick.

Your subject will have to really be patient till you get everything right. This may be cool when shooting friends and family, but if you are on the street and want to get that quick portrait with a defocussed background, then that can prove difficult.On the video front, the iPhone 7 Plus can shoot up to 4K resolution videos. The OIS on the phone ensures that there is minimal camera shake, although you do see a slight jello effect when walking and shooting. The camera region does get warm when shooting videos. But not enough to cause it to shut down, as I have observed with Sony flagship smartphones.Battery Life: 8/10Coming with a 2900mAh non-removable battery, the iPhone 7 Plus has seen a bump in this department as compared to the previous generation. In a word, the battery life is excellent. There wasn’t a day in the two weeks that I was using the phone, when I found the battery to be draining out before my work day. In fact, with a 100 percent charge at 8AM, and after a day of regular usage, I would still have around 20 percent charge remaining till around 10PM. Heavy usage including playing games, streaming video, calling, messaging via multiple apps, using the camera extensively did drain out the battery by around 9PM. The battery usage numbers show some really good numbers with a 16 hour plus usage time and standby time of over 40 hours. It also offers the Low Power mode, which further extends the battery.Charging seems to take forever though. It easily takes over 3 hours to go from sub-10 percent to 100 percent charge. In an age of rapid charging technologies available on all Android flagships, where you can go from 0 to 100 in just over an hour’s time, Apple’s charging technology seems dated. The good thing is that the iPhone 7 Plus can hold the charge for that much longer vis-a-vis an Android phone. But it’s about time Apple get some sort of quick charging onboard.

So that could also be a possible contender.\\n',\n",

SIM EJECTOR PIN--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE DESIGN-=============So the new iPhone 7 black variant has a nice aluminum body with matte finish. the iPhone 7 is also now waterproof with IP67 rating. the 12mp rear camera with the led flash are present on the back, the power button with the I'm tray are present on the right side, the volume rockers and the profile button are located on the left side, on the front we have the 7mp f2.2 camera, ear piece, sensors and the 4.7 inch 1334x750-pixel resolution at 326\\xa0ppi display and the home button are present, now the home button is not really a button, it has what apple calls the taptic engine which gives a haptic feedback and simulated a real button, but doesn't really feels like a button, you can select the type of haptic feedback you like form three options. the home button also has the fingerprint scanner or touch id, its a nice quick and accurate scanner. the 4.7 inch display great too. with great viewing angles, vibrancy, and color reproduction. the colors looks natural and with nice saturation and contrast. expected nothing less from apple on this. now the biggest down side of this phone is the removal of the headphone, apple says that the lightning connector works great as an audio source for headphones, but I still miss my the 3.5mm jack, apple did provide a small lightning to 3.5mm adapter which is something you also need to carry around if you want to listen from your normal headphones or you have to switch to Bluetooth audio.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE CAMERA-=============the camera has a good improvement from the iPhone 6s, it doesn't have dual cameras like the iPhone 7 plus, but it performs great. the are very detailed with great color reproduction, contrast level. the images are vibrant with good amount of saturation and sharpness. the 12mp camera now also have optical image stabilization so the video are nice and stabilized as the iPhone 6s it also shoots in 4k, the front facing 7mp camera has been improved a lot, its has nice wide frame and the image quality is also very natural, the video quality of the front facing camera is also nice you have to be careful with lighting or otherwise the contrast levels sometimes gets messed up.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE PERFORMENCE-======================the iPhone 7 has the apple A10 fusion chips with six core graphics and 2gb of ram, the new processor performs great, it easily handles heavy usage and gaming, multitasking is also very fluid, it easily handles tons of app running in the background simultaneously with just 2gb of ram. the iPhone 7 comes with the new iOS 10 which has great features like the new version of siri and improved 3d touch. if you are a moderate user it will work flawlessly for you. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE BATTERY-================the iPhone 7 only have a 1960 mah battery, but don't let that small size fool you it easily lasts a day even under heavy usage you can easily get it to work till night. another down side of this phone is that it doesn't support fast charging, it takes around 2 hours to fully charge from 10% to 100%. but you can also use an ipad charger to make the charging speed a little bit faster.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE PROS AND CONS--THE PROS-==========1. GREAT BUILD QUALITY2. WATERPROOF3. GREAT CAMERA4. GREAT DISPLAY5. FINGERPRINT SCANNER6. GREAT FOR GAMING7. GREAT FOR MULTITASKING8. STEREO SPEAKERS-THE CONS-============1. NO HEADPHONE JACK2. NO FAST CHARGING-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FINAL VERDICT- The iPhone is a great flagship smartphone with great specs, performance and camera, it might not be that much worth to upgrade from an iPhone 6 or 6s but if you want the better camera, waterproofing you can definitely go for it.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[...]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THANK YOU\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\nFirstly, let me clarify.. I do not belong to Apple Die hard fans and followers' club.I too was drawn towards this device as a replacement when my Moto E First Gen one fine day stopped working and didn't recover.So this is a transition from Android to iOS.Am I missing Android ? Honestly - NO.I thought it's time to buy a perfect and latest device for myself, not because I was completely sure of what it does, just because I could now afford it.I know, iPhone 8 and iPhone X are in the market today. But this phone in every respect is still relevant today and in no way can be considered outdated. If you wish you buy an iPhone that doesn't hit your pocket much and is not outdated, this is the most perfect phone to buy today.Buying 6 or 6s would be a risk because apple might stop supporting its update in a few years.As I mentioned, this review is not from a crazy Apple product lover. (Although it may sound like one)Pros:1. The screen dimensions and phone size is perfect. It's exactly what I need. Not too thick and not extremely flimsy. Though some might prefer the iPhone 7 plus, I think it's too big to carry in your pocket.2. Processor and Speed: this I noticed not just about this iPhone but for iPad also, the processor speed is really awesome. Windows laptops, android phones and tabs do hang and freeze. This phone in last one year has NEVER. It might not sound much of a big deal but usually phones hang when you desperately need them in urgency and you don't want to be in that position ever.3. Screen Quality: the screen looks amazing and Colors are extremely fine.4. Camera: now please note that this is not a DSLR. So no matter how much the phone companies advertise, phone cameras will always be inferior to a professional DLSR. That's the reason why camera companies aren't out of business. Having said that, the camera of this phone (both front and back) are really good and they do their job.6. No Headphone Jack: I thought it would be a matter of concern, but it isn't. It has only motivated me to take care of my headphone even more and that's the only reason they are still intact and working properly. I am sure you won't miss the jack. Besides, if you fear losing the small adapter, it's better to buy Bluetooth headphones. They fit it really well with this phone.7. Cross platform flexibility: this is what I was most worried about. How this device would blend in with my windows laptop and all other apps and features which I earlier used in windows and Android. Surprisingly, the transition was smooth and hassle free. There may be people who disagree, but I never missed any feature which android provided. Infact, itunes, iCloud and other apple features have made the life much easier as compared to android.8. 32 GB storage: I think it's sufficient today. Most people use their phones as storage devices. If you're one of them then even 256GB variant is not enough. So install the apps you actually use, backup the photos in to your laptop regularly, put videos and songs only the ones you listen and actually watch. You will surprise yourself that filling up 32GB space is also difficult.Now, most importantly...CONS:1. Body Finishing: You have to have a back cover for this phone in order to avoid it slipping from your hands. The tighter you grip it without cover, the easily it would slip.Also, I initially used a cover which had a seive pattern on it. The same pattern got imprinted on back of the phone (though not easily visible). Go for an all solid or all plastic cover which can provide grip.2. Battery backup: The battery backup of this phone is bit of a problem. With moderate usage also, it can consume battery before the end of the day and you have to be very economical about it.3. No dual sim: I know, many would frown after reading this. And I know why Apple has still not released a dual sim iPhone.. but I wish this phone was dual sim. The other 2 cons can be mitigated, this one however can only be settled by having a backup phone. Add the Dual sim feature and apple would bring in a swarm of new users who hesitated from iPhone.iPhone ACCESSORIES RECOMMENDATION1. Screen Guard: you may go for any standard screen guard but honestly you don't need one. No screen guard can protect your screen from breaking. I have not used any screen guard for more than year and the screen looks as new. Just make sure you don't put the keys and phone in the same pocket and surely phone will shine for years. Also, let me mention here that my phone HAS FALLEN from a decent height face down on solid floor twice but the glass is strong enough to sustain without absolutely no physical damage.2. Back cover: I think this is a must accessory. You need not spend much on this. Egotude transparent color (black shade) will go perfectly with it. It provides the necessary grip and scratch resistance to your phone back.3. Headphones: in case you lose your Apple earphones, as per your budget, buy a Bluetooth headset, something that suits your pocket and you're good to go.4. Cleaning Spray and Cloth: If you wish to keep your phone new and clean, please invest in this. It's a very small investment but the returns are huge. Buy any camera lens cleaning Spray and soft cloth. Every 10-15 days, take the phone out of cover and thoroughly clean the phone and cover as well. Your phone will shine a little longer and will look brand new for years. All it needs is just a little touch of care from you.Hope the review helps. Cheers 🖖🏻\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nNOTE:  This review is addressed to that class of people for whom Rs.60000-70000 smartphone is once in five years thing.Before you judge the rating which I have given and draw conclusions, I just want to let people who read this review realize that I am after technology with some innovation and out of the box concept as I never use a smartphone beyond 12 months.  In this process, I literally used every high-end smartphone that was launched after iPhone 3G (my first hold of a smartphone), be it xperia, blackberry, samsung, nexus, HTC, what not!Now, coming to the point of fake ratings.  I am a bit surprised to see so many negative reviews for an iPhone 7 on Amazon.  KINDLY SEE FLIPKART, without the product even launched on their site, there are 864 ratings and as much as 4.9 stars out of 5 and not a single review (I am enclosing a pic for your reference).  So, there is something which doesn\\'t catch our eye.  But these are the lame tricks that get played when you go neck to neck in competition, it applies to either side.ABOUT APPLEUndoubtedly, I give huge credit to Apple for introducing smartphone concept and in the process they slowly killed the once mighty Blackberry.  Like Thomas Edison, credit goes to Apple for inventing such a masterpiece.  But we are still not using the same bulb which Edison has invented.  There are so many companies which are reinventing bulbs every year.  Apple followed it up for few years with some changes in iPhone to keep the customer base solid.  There is so much hype created over every Apple launch and in the process, the adversaries tried to copy the launch styles of Apple.  So, they clearly have the margin.  But, they are surely lagging behind in terms of innovation.  This year iPhone 7 is one that\\'s a perfect example.COMING TO THE PHONEWatched the launch event so closely, like I always do every year.  I was using an iPhone 6 and was waiting for 7 (I have had an occasion to handle and experience both iPhone 7 and 7 plus even before they were launched in India).  And finally ended up with Galaxy S7 Edge for a reason (BEFORE COMMENTING, RE-READ WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN IN THE FIRST TWO PARAGRAPHS OF MY REVIEW).  I opted for S7 Edge for its curvy screen design with brilliant colours and the camera which beats the iPhone  The dual camera on iPhone 7 plus is not new to the world before its launch.  Secondly, they have their eyes set for the 10th Annniversary of iPhone in 2017 and are holding their cards till then.  Both iOS and Android have their own pros and cons.  This is the area which I am carefully and deliberately side lining and focusing on the phone.This year launch of iPhone 7 is only for those geeks, unlike me, who actually stick to iPhone for life and for whom the price tag is just a symbol to flaunt.  Honestly, as most of the Apple users agree, what matters is the design of the phone.  If i see a person standing about 5 feet away from me with an iPhone 7 (not plus) and me holding my iPhone 6, a third person will obviously think we are using the same phone (not talking about brand).  So, if I were to shell Rs.60000 for a phone which retains the same design crafted with precision for three straight years, I better buy a device which satisfies me with its looks and performs as closely as an iPhone but loses the battle.  And with Rs.20000 cheaper.  I put my chips in there.  Unless you have to run tasks which need some significant power like Games, it\\'s not worth an upgrade or a first time buy.lI would request people to just think a bit before investing your hard earned money to go for iPhone 7.  Join the line in which I am standing for the \"revolutionary\" design of an iPhone 8 in 2017.  Because, that\\'s when Apple is gonna show again to the world that they are masters of innovation.All the best!\\n',\n",
       " '\\nNice product\\n',\n",
       " '\\nAwesome software and camera… sturdy, premium and good speed after 5 years too…\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe iPhone 7\\'s notable camera, battery and water resistance improvements are a worthwhile upgrades to a familiar phone design, but ask yourself if you really need an upgrade...and if the Plus might be a better choice.  GOOD SIDEs  (+)______________# Improved cameras very well,# The front with 7 MP camera is giving you really good pictures.# Even the back shooter also is a very good camera.# Beautiful design# Screen and battery life is also improved# Water resistance# Tap-tic engine feedback is neat# Powerful dual speakers# Starts at 32GB, finally# Ios 10, it actually really works well with the hardware of the phone. Every thing run smoothly, looking from gaming to test massaging or browsing the web at the same time, every thing is very smooth# Software update is always on time, this is the apple\\'s best thing  BAD SIDEs  (-)____________# No headphone jack# Iterative design# Many of the \"groundbreaking\" features have been on Android phones for a while# Wireless audio ecosystem is immature# Jet Black model scratches easilyReasons to BUY The iPhone 7_________________________# VERY FAST.... Giving apple A10 fusion chip, which is 40% faster than previous, as well as 50% faster graphics.# FLASH DRIVE.... If you are worried about storage, then, SanDisk offering \"iXpand\" Flash drive upto 128 gb at 8500/- Rs.product link  >((  http://www.amazon.in/SanDisk-iXpand-Flash-iPhones-Computers/dp/B01F6RWV94/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1499795607&sr=1-1&keywords=external%2Bdrive%2Bfor%2Biphone&th=1  ))# WATER & DUST RESISTANCE.... Now the iPhone 7 has IP67 water resistance, no need to worry about the water under 15 cm.# CAMERAS..... We have some great cameras on iPhone 7 or 7 plus. Now iPhone 7 has optical stabilization, which something we didn\\'t having in previous iPhone, also get 1.8 aperture. And 7 MP front facing camera which will give decent photos, also 1080p video recording from front.#STEREO SPEAKERS.....  This time around we don\\'t have 1 speaker, we have 2 speakers, one at the top and one at the bottom. they are very loud, which is really need.# COLOR... Now iPhone comes with beautiful jet black and matte black. You will fall in love with the phone. Reasons NOT To Buy The iPhone 7_____________________________# DESIGN.... Apple making almost same design from so many generation. Its nice to having something nice, some thing new. all other competitors are trying for something new.# CAMERA BUMP..... The camera bump looks ugly, If apple had make the device a little bit thicker, there would be no camera bump, and you have the space for BIGGER BATTERY, which will made big deference. It have longer life battery because of optimization of new processor.# BATTERY..... We still don\\'t have the fast charging or wireless charging. Now wireless charging  i get not everybody use this, But fast charger we really need for this. Yes we have fast charger with iPad, but we need fast charger along the iPhone itself, which will charge faster.# HEAD PHONE JACK..... This is a too much of big a deal, Yes they are giving lightning converter, but if you listening something to your headphone wide, working on your phone, and you need to charge, that will be big issue.# MICRO SD CARD SLOT.... Specially i really miss the absence of Micro SD card slot. I think every body is. We really need micro SD slot on iPhone for more space option. But yeah this option will little bit slow down to iPhone performance.# CUSTOMIZABILITY ON IOS.... If you are a person that really like to customize your phone, then ios is definitely not for you.So that is it. Thank You.I THINK IT WILL HELP YOU.Thank you Amazon India\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nOverview - On the outside, the new iPhone looks basically the same as the iPhone 6/6s. They are now water resistant, which is nice, although they’re not fully waterproof, keep them submerged in a meter of water for more than 30 minutes and things might not go your way.Once you wrap your head around the missing audio jack (it's not the end of it, you can get a designated adapter for your favorite headphones), the Apple iPhone 7 is a major upgrade. IP67-certified water-resistant body. Bigger and brighter camera with OIS. New FaceTime cam. Stereo speakers. Faster processor and 50% GPU performance increase, more RAM. New pressure-sensitive Home key powered by a new taptic engine. Revised storage options.Battery - iPhone 7 is powered with the newest A10 Fusion chip. It is a quad core processor which helps in better managing the battery life. It takes around 2hrs to completely charge from 0-100% and the battery usually lasts a day. I am a heavy user, and use the phone quite a lot during the day. Whatsapp, Twitter, Calling and Messaging are the main battery draining apps for me. I will be left with 20-25% battery at the end of the day with typical usage.Performance - Apple made the best mobile chipset from which others can only learn from. Its dual-core processor, even without the help of the tiny energy efficient cores, beats any other processor out there. The A10 GPU is equally impressive acing every graphic benchmark. The iPhone 7 is the fastest and most powerful smartphone in the world as of now.Audio - iPhone 7 has stereo speakers, considering my previous iPhone was the 5s, it is a huge upgrade for me in the audio performance. Loudspeaker is pretty good, audio output is loud and clear. Call quality is damn good.Camera - The colors and contrast are great and the dynamic range is simply great - much like you would get on dedicated big cameras. In any case, the iPhone 7 delivers the most balanced dynamic range from any smartphone at the moment. The optical image stabilization is the addition that really matters as it will keep the lens steady and won't allow for blurry shots at low-light. The front-facing camera got its resolution boosted to 7MP and records 1080p video. It can use Retina flash, where your screen lights up in different colors depending on the intended white balance of the scene. Pretty good when taking selfies in dark environment. Coming to the 4k video recording, it is the best camera when it comes to 4k Video, Period.Overall a great package and the phone will definitely last 3+ years if used carefully. There won't be any performance issues considering Apple will provide updates regularly and the phone won't lag after using it for a year or so unlike the android phones. The phone is also water and dust resistant, if we accidentally end up dropping the phone in water, there is no need to worry. The phone can even be used to take pictures in swimming pool and shallow water(Be careful with the depth of water else phone will be toast). Putting a case and a screen protector will ruin the beauty of phone and the phone won't feel the same, but if you are the one who drops the phone constantly then Case and Screen protectors are necessary evils. I got it for a price of 36500/- in the Great Indian Sale :pAbsolutely Loving it !!\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nI got the delivery of this phone on December 30th. I bought an iphone 7 specifically because of the button when I broke my old 6S.Since the day I bought this phone, it had been showing battery drain and overheating. I thought it would be due to the intense icloud downloads that the phone was doing in the background. Ever since day 1, the phone wouldn\\'t receive calls or can make calls. I thought it would be a network issue.I tried doing a return after 2 days noticing the phone\\'s not showing any signs of proper useability without a charger at hand at all times. But Amazon would not allow me to return it saying contact Apple support. Now apple support was on Holidays till 3rd of January.Finally when I got to Apple support, they have done a diagnostic and couldn\\'t find anything unusual, but asked me to observe for 3 more days. 3 more days, I contacted Apple for them to tell me to take it to a service center. Still cannot make phone calls or receive them. I tried returning through multiple different options, which all led me back to amazon responding saying contact apple support. I went to the Vodafone store to confirm if I had any network issues, only for them to find out, no matter which sim they put in my phone, it will not make or receive phone calls.So I went to the service centre for them to keep my phone under observation for another 5 days. And they acknowledged the phone\\'s showing temperature and battery drain, but since Apple diagnosis isn\\'t showing any issues, they asked me to continue using the phone for another 1-2 weeks.Now, as they did restore the phone, I tried coming back home with my sim card, only to see, the same issue, that I cannot make phone calls or receive them. I can send/receive text messages. I contacted Apple support again, for them to acknowledge now that there is an issue and I have to send it for service.Now as the return period is conveniently over, Amazon refuses to do anything to take the faulty product back. I have wasted 2 weeks of time and energy running around trying to get this phone fixed, only to waste another week or two for the phone to go out and get repaired and come back.Amazon has responded asking me to get a \"service denied letter\" from Apple support for them to refund and take return of this product that I have wasted 2 weeks on.So, long story short, go buy it from a local store. You buy it from Amazon, be prepared to chase tails and run around like headless chicken to sort out any issue you\\'re facing. Worse, if you\\'re in a place with no local authorised apple service centre.\\n']"

       "['Build and Design: 8/10The iPhone 7 Plus does not come with a drastically new design. You can look at it more of adding finesse to the iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6s Plus designs. The similar design is now in its third generation. Is Apple holding out till next year, to release a brand new design language? Not that it is bad in the current state, but it dosen’t make it stand out from its predecessors. Not to mention, the designs from its Android arch-rivals has certainly seen changes over the years.The first thing that you will notice when you handle the phone, is that the visible antenna lines have been nicely camouflaged. While it is still visible to an extent on the Rose Gold, Silver and Gold variants of the phone; on the Matte Black and Jet Black versions, you have to really look for it.The rounded edges, power / standby, volume rocker buttons and the ringer notch are all in the same spot as the iPhone 6s Plus. So is the home button. But there’s a catch. The circular button isn’t a push button anymore but is supported by the Taptic Engine’s feedback mechanism. The Taptic Engine which supports the 3D touch mechanism for the display, also controls the touch response on the button. You can set the levels of feedback for the button, and honestly after a while you forget that the button isn’t there. It is one cool implementation. And it is such fine design details that make Apple products what they are.The edges are 7.3mm thick and it weighs around 188 grams. While the thickness is the same as its predecessor, it is around 4 grams lighter. In terms of overall feel of the phone and sturdiness, there isn’t much different from the iPhone 6s Plus. And the complaint we had with the 6s Plus remains. The iPhone 7 Plus offers a terrible body to screen ratio as compared to some of its Android flagships such as the Galaxy S7 edge or the newly launched Google Pixel XL, which offers 5.5-inch display in a more compact body.The rear side has a bump in the top left hand corner which houses two 12MP camera sensors. Snapping on cover on the iPhone brings the camera bump with the plane of the iPhone back.There is one important addition though. It is IP67 certified which makes it water and dust resistant.Metal back is still as slippery as its predecessors. Apple has some really cool leather covers with metallic button areas if you have buttery hands. They sell separately, of course. Snapping them on further reduces ease of one-handed use. And no, you cannot use the last generation covers on this phone for obvious reasons. I got the matte black variant to review, and it looks quite wonderful, as compared to the other three colours. The Jet Black variant is still the more premium variant, and I would not be surprised if we see more Jet black or piano black phone colours over the coming months.Features: 8.5/10Thanks to a limited product portfolio in its smartphone segment, Apple really ensures that the internals get a good amount of upgrade in the coming generations. To that extent, the iPhone 7 Plus comes with the Apple A10 Fusion chipset which has a quad-core processor clocked at 2.23GHz. This is paired with 3GB RAM. It comes with a 5.5-inch Full HD resolution display.There are three storage variants – 32GB, 128GB and 256GB of which we have the 256GB variant for review. There is no expandable storage.It runs on iOS 10. A single nano SIM card slot is present on the right hand side, just below the power/standby button. It supports dual band Wi-Fi 802.11 ac, Wi-fi hotspot, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS with A-GPS and GLONASS, NFC only for Apply Pay which is not available in India. And also, no FM radio.The big changes on the features front is the dropping of the 3.5mm audio jack. You will need a lightning port connector on your earphones. Apple bundles a pair. Other option is using a Bluetooth headset to enjoy your music. Apple has also bundled in a lightning port to 3.5 mm audio jack adapter for those who still want to rely on their personal audio gear. This is one move that drew a lot of flak as a lot of us still prefer using personal earphones / headphones which still have a 3.5mm jack. But give it some time and you will see a lot more lightning port earphone accessories, going by Apple’s history of spawning off accessories market segments. The iPhone 7 Plus comes with stereo speakers finally, with one being at the base and the other on the earpiece speaker.On the camera front, you get two 12MP sensors on the back and there is a 7MP front-facing FaceTime HD camera. Apple has implemented the dual rear cameras in a way that you get to use true 2x optical zoom.Display: 8/10The iPhone 7 Plus sports a 5.5inch FullHD display which gives a pixel density of 401PPI. The panel is an LED backlit IPS LCD panel. However with the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple claims to be using a wide gamut display (cinema standard). When placed side by side with the iPhone 6s/6s Plus, I noticed that the iPhone 7 Plus had a slight warm tinge to it. The iPhone 7 Plus is definitely a notch brighter than the 6s Plus. The Night Shift mode lets you select the time when you want to display to control the blue light, and it also lets you select the shade of yellow that you are comfortable with. This added granularity is a nice touch.Colour reproduction is spot on and it is still a class-leading display among smartphones. Colours aren’t unnecessarily vivid. Legibility in sunlight is not an issue, as its auto-brightness mode works quite well. The display, as has been the case with previous generations, is quite glossy. It was while shooting in bright sunlight where at times all I could see on the display was my reflection, specially when shooting from chest height. Not so much at the eye level.The black levels on the display are quite good and watching movies or playing games is a lot of fun. Games such as Vain Glory, Real Racing 3, Nova 3 look gorgeous on this calibrated display.Software: 8/10Apple iPhone 7 Plus comes with the latest iOS 10 operating system. The one running on the review unit was 10.0.3 on which majority of the testing was done, before switching to the 10.1 beta to access the Portrait mode in the Camera app. The iOS 10 is refined and operationally quite smooth on most occasions. There were a few instances of apps not registering action on first tap.iOS 10 dosen’t look very different from its predecessor, but packs in a lot of new features. For starters, you can now uninstall the native Apple apps if you don’t need them. I figured I would do without Stocks, Home and a couple of other apps which I deleted. Technically it just hides the icon and deletes all the app data from your phone. You can reinstall the app by searching for it in the App store.The 3D touch still offers the Peek and Pop features, with support added to a lot more apps than we had seen when the 6s Plus launched.Messages has got a complete revamp with the app letting you add in GIF animations; finger gestures –  creating animations such as heart break, beating heart and more; send photos from the camera while in the app; share music and so on. While these additions are playing catch up to the likes of apps such as Telegram, it makes little sense to use Messages if your family or friend circle isn’t on Apple devices.Control Centre has been modified, with the music control shifted to a new tab. Also the four icons at the base – torch, timer, calculator and camera support 3D gestures, letting you access more functions without leaving the Control Centre screen. iOS 10 also lets you do a lot from the lock screen itself. You can swipe left to open the camera or swipe right to access widgets or swipe from the top to bottom to see notifications. There’s also the ‘Raise to Wake up’ feature which wakes up the display when you just lift your iPhone to your face if its lying in the sleep mode on your desk.Music app has got some design changes. Instead of My Music, you now get a Library tab which lets you enlist a variety of options from Playlists, Artists, Album, Songs and so on. You can download songs if you are a subscriber, optimise storage by setting a limit on auto downloads, auto-generated playlists in the ‘For You’ section and more.The Photos app has got some additions in the form of Memories, where in iOS makes albums based on your photos shot at a particular location. In short, this is Apple Photos playing catch up to Google Photos, which has much more interesting features.Siri was the star feature of the iPhones when it was first announced back in 2011. Since then Google has been getting better with its AI-backed virtual assistant game – first Google Now and this year the Google Assistant. Between the two, we noticed that the Assistant was able to understand accents better and let you have contextual conversations, whereas with Siri you still have to pay attention to your diction.Even asking Siri simple questions such as “what was the iPhone 7 Plus pricing for India” or “when was Siri released?” the responses weren’t very forth coming. Also between the two I also realised that most of the times you have to ask Siri questions in a particular way, and you cannot ask follow up questions and get satisfactory responses as you do with Assistant. Apple says Siri is a self-learning system, so maybe it needs more usage. But after using it for a week, it isn’t significantly better than Google Assistant. One thing I would grant Siri is the way it presents card information – is much more richer and informative than Google.Performance: 9/10Call quality is top notch with audible earpiece speaker even in high traffic situations. The iPhone 7 Plus supports Cat 9 LTE, voice over LTE, Wi-fi calling. I did not find any connectivity issues with a Jio SIM card on it, and was able to make successful VoLTE calls.With the latest Apple A10 Fusion chipset paired with 3GB of RAM (the highest seen on an Apple iPhone) you get a wicked fast device. The A10 Fusion chipset houses a quad-core processor, with two high power cores clocked at 2.23GHz and two low power saving ones. There’s a six-core GPU as well. The single core performance score of 3445 observed on GeekBench 4 was the highest we have seen on any smartphone we have tested so far. Even the multi-core score is only second to Huawei P9. The AnTuTu benchmark gives 186093 – again the highest score.In terms of raw numbers, the iPhone 7 Plus comes out tops. In real life usage though, the phone runs lag free and things such as app switching, finger print scanning work fast. The phone does get warm when you are on a particularly photography heavy day, but never crossing 36-38 degree mark on the Fluke IR thermometer.Gaming on the phone is smooth. No frame drops were observed on high end games such Vain Glory, Nova 3, Real Racing 3 and so on. Watching movies with the stereo speakers is quite a fine experience. The speakers are quite loud, but in certain applications such as YouTube, we observed that using the headphones was a battery option.Camera: 8.5/10One of the highlight feature of the iPhone 7 Plus is the presence of the dual rear camera setup. Sure, this isn’t the first time we are seeing a dual camera on a smartphone. Huawei and LG have done this before. But just like all things Apple, the implementation is different. There are two 12MP sensors, one is standard camera which has an equivalent focal length of 28mm (with an f/1.8 aperture) and the other sensor has a telephoto lens having a 56mm focal length (with an f/2.8 aperture). The standard 28mm lens comes with OIS, whereas the telephoto lens does not. This implementation lets the iPhone 7 Plus offer true 2x optical zoom. The Camera app lets you easily switch regular wide angle shot and the 2x optical zoom shot. This ensures that there is no loss in detail when taking 2x zoom photos.While it may seem like they are two different cameras, they do tend to work together everytime you fire off the shutter. You can use these two lenses when shooting videos as well, but switching to the 2x zoom, will remove the OIS feature. The two lenses work quite well in the Portrait mode which is currently available on the iOS 10.1 beta. Also another thing to note is that the telephoto lens can only be used in well lit situations, and if the light isn’t enough, the iPhone 7 Plus will use the regular lens with 2x digital zoom. Apple’s image processor takes this decision on the fly.The iPhone 7 Plus has a 7MP front facing FaceTime HD camera and quad LED flash unit on the rear side. Features carried forward from the iPhone 6s Plus include the live photos, phase detect autofocus. The Camera app is also similar to the one seen in the last generation.Coming to the image quality, the iPhone 7 Plus just like its predecessors, delivers. Colours come out natural and at times it may look a bit too dull when compared with images coming out of say a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge or even the latest Google Pixel XL. Apple iPhone 7 Plus gives a neutral output, with good amount of detail, great dynamic range. Optical zoom works quite well in bright outdoors. You also get the option of using 10x digital zoom for still images and 6x digital zoom for video. Use this only in emergency situations as there is a lot of artifacts you will get in the final images. When forcing the HDR mode, we also noticed some artifacts around the edges if the subject moved too much, as is seen in the fur of the labrador in the image below, around the right paw.Panoramas come out really good, and there is good exposure control. You can also get HDR Panorama shots with the new camera app. There were instances when shooting panoramas in bright sunlight, where I noticed mild change in the sky exposure. But the image stitching is relatively better than that seen on Android phones. The 2x optical zoom also offers Panorama mode.Focussing is relatively quick. But time to first shot is still slow as compared to the quicker ways in which you can turn on cameras in some Android phones. Double tapping the home button to launch the camera is really a no brainer which Apple should implement.Low light image quality is good, but in a side by side comparison with the Google Pixel XL, I noticed that the Pixel XL clearly took the lead there. I’m not saying iPhone 7 Plus is a bad camera in low light – far from it. But the noise control, detail retention, dynamic range seen on the Galaxy S7 and Pixel XL is notches above the iPhone 7 Plus.The Portrait mode was one area which Apple spoke about a lot during the launch. During the time of testing it was only available on the beta, though it is now available to everyone. Once you turn on the Portrait mode, you will get instructions below the rounded square frame, whether you need to move closer or farther. Once you get the lock, the focussing frame becomes yellow and you fire the shutter. Images clicked in the portrait mode turned out good, it works specially well when you are in a well lit area and there is respectable distance between the subject and the background. The blurring of the background is nicely done and isn’t as aggressive as what we have seen with other dual camera phones. The good thing is that you can see the shallow depth of field while you are composing the shot. But the problem is that it will take some practise to get the shot faster. Your subject will have to really be patient till you get everything right. This may be cool when shooting friends and family, but if you are on the street and want to get that quick portrait with a defocussed background, then that can prove difficult.On the video front, the iPhone 7 Plus can shoot up to 4K resolution videos. The OIS on the phone ensures that there is minimal camera shake, although you do see a slight jello effect when walking and shooting. The camera region does get warm when shooting videos. But not enough to cause it to shut down, as I have observed with Sony flagship smartphones.Battery Life: 8/10Coming with a 2900mAh non-removable battery, the iPhone 7 Plus has seen a bump in this department as compared to the previous generation. In a word, the battery life is excellent. There wasn’t a day in the two weeks that I was using the phone, when I found the battery to be draining out before my work day. In fact, with a 100 percent charge at 8AM, and after a day of regular usage, I would still have around 20 percent charge remaining till around 10PM. Heavy usage including playing games, streaming video, calling, messaging via multiple apps, using the camera extensively did drain out the battery by around 9PM. The battery usage numbers show some really good numbers with a 16 hour plus usage time and standby time of over 40 hours. It also offers the Low Power mode, which further extends the battery.Charging seems to take forever though. It easily takes over 3 hours to go from sub-10 percent to 100 percent charge. In an age of rapid charging technologies available on all Android flagships, where you can go from 0 to 100 in just over an hour’s time, Apple’s charging technology seems dated. The good thing is that the iPhone 7 Plus can hold the charge for that much longer vis-a-vis an Android phone. But it’s about time Apple get some sort of quick charging onboard. Is it holding that out for the 10th anniversary edition?Verdict and Price in IndiaAll things considered, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus is a great device. It excels in departments such as battery life, performance, display among other things. The iOS 10 also brings a lot of new features to the table. The implementation of the dual rear camera is quite intelligent. Also portrait mode will be quite loved by those who love that kind of photography – it will just require patience though. While the camera image quality is good, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus still leaves scope for improvement in the low light photography department as we observed in out Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus shootout.If you are on the iPhone 6/6 Plus and are looking for an upgrade, the iPhone 7/7 Plus could be considered. For the 6s / 6s Plus users, there is little to no reason for upgrade. You would rather wait out this iteration for the 10th year iPhone edition.While the iPhone 7 Plus is good, it looks like Apple is leaving the better things for its 10th year edition. Things such as similar design, no quick charging support, similar camera app (which still makes you dig into the General settings to make tweaks in resolution and the like) among other areas have been carried forward from previous two generations. There’s a high possibility that some of these issues would hopefully be addressed in the next gen iPhone.Prices start from Rs 72,000 for 32GB, Rs 82,000 for 128GB and Rs 92,000 for the 256GB variant of the iPhone 7 Plus. The prices are high, and yes you can get a lot more in that amount. But if you want to invest in an iPhone, this is what you have to pay. A lot of telcos are offering the iPhone 7/7 Plus with various data packs as compared to Android competition. Thankfully, the pricing is in line with what it was last year. If 5.5-inch is too large a size for you, then opt for the iPhone 7 which still retains most of the internal features seen on the iPhone 7 Plus.If you are still not convinced about the iPhone 7 Plus, or are short on budget, the Android flagships that you can consider include the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge which is still a powerful device. I have been testing the Google Pixel XL for some days now, and it has already shown its capability in the low light department as compared to the iPhone 7 Plus. So that could also be a possible contender.',\n",

       " \"I'm writing this review after using the iPhone 7 for about a week, here are the things that I liked, disliked and thought are worth to mention.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WHATS IN THE BOX-==================1. THE IPHONE 7 ITSELF2. THE LIGHTNING EARPODS3. LIGHTNING TO 3.5 MM JACK CONVERTOR4. LIGHTNING TO USB CABLE5. POWER ADAPTER6. SIM EJECTOR PIN--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE DESIGN-=============So the new iPhone 7 black variant has a nice aluminum body with matte finish. the iPhone 7 is also now waterproof with IP67 rating. the 12mp rear camera with the led flash are present on the back, the power button with the I'm tray are present on the right side, the volume rockers and the profile button are located on the left side, on the front we have the 7mp f2.2 camera, ear piece, sensors and the 4.7 inch 1334x750-pixel resolution at 326\\xa0ppi display and the home button are present, now the home button is not really a button, it has what apple calls the taptic engine which gives a haptic feedback and simulated a real button, but doesn't really feels like a button, you can select the type of haptic feedback you like form three options. the home button also has the fingerprint scanner or touch id, its a nice quick and accurate scanner. the 4.7 inch display great too. with great viewing angles, vibrancy, and color reproduction. the colors looks natural and with nice saturation and contrast. expected nothing less from apple on this. now the biggest down side of this phone is the removal of the headphone, apple says that the lightning connector works great as an audio source for headphones, but I still miss my the 3.5mm jack, apple did provide a small lightning to 3.5mm adapter which is something you also need to carry around if you want to listen from your normal headphones or you have to switch to Bluetooth audio.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE CAMERA-=============the camera has a good improvement from the iPhone 6s, it doesn't have dual cameras like the iPhone 7 plus, but it performs great. the are very detailed with great color reproduction, contrast level. the images are vibrant with good amount of saturation and sharpness. the 12mp camera now also have optical image stabilization so the video are nice and stabilized as the iPhone 6s it also shoots in 4k, the front facing 7mp camera has been improved a lot, its has nice wide frame and the image quality is also very natural, the video quality of the front facing camera is also nice you have to be careful with lighting or otherwise the contrast levels sometimes gets messed up.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE PERFORMENCE-======================the iPhone 7 has the apple A10 fusion chips with six core graphics and 2gb of ram, the new processor performs great, it easily handles heavy usage and gaming, multitasking is also very fluid, it easily handles tons of app running in the background simultaneously with just 2gb of ram. the iPhone 7 comes with the new iOS 10 which has great features like the new version of siri and improved 3d touch. if you are a moderate user it will work flawlessly for you. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE BATTERY-================the iPhone 7 only have a 1960 mah battery, but don't let that small size fool you it easily lasts a day even under heavy usage you can easily get it to work till night. another down side of this phone is that it doesn't support fast charging, it takes around 2 hours to fully charge from 10% to 100%. but you can also use an ipad charger to make the charging speed a little bit faster.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE PROS AND CONS--THE PROS-==========1. GREAT BUILD QUALITY2. WATERPROOF3. GREAT CAMERA4. GREAT DISPLAY5. FINGERPRINT SCANNER6. GREAT FOR GAMING7. GREAT FOR MULTITASKING8. STEREO SPEAKERS-THE CONS-============1. NO HEADPHONE JACK2. NO FAST CHARGING-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FINAL VERDICT- The iPhone is a great flagship smartphone with great specs, performance and camera, it might not be that much worth to upgrade from an iPhone 6 or 6s but if you want the better camera, waterproofing you can definitely go for it.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[...]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THANK YOU\",\n",
       " \"Firstly, let me clarify.. I do not belong to Apple Die hard fans and followers' club.I too was drawn towards this device as a replacement when my Moto E First Gen one fine day stopped working and didn't recover.So this is a transition from Android to iOS.Am I missing Android ? Honestly - NO.I thought it's time to buy a perfect and latest device for myself, not because I was completely sure of what it does, just because I could now afford it.I know, iPhone 8 and iPhone X are in the market today. But this phone in every respect is still relevant today and in no way can be considered outdated. If you wish you buy an iPhone that doesn't hit your pocket much and is not outdated, this is the most perfect phone to buy today.Buying 6 or 6s would be a risk because apple might stop supporting its update in a few years.As I mentioned, this review is not from a crazy Apple product lover. (Although it may sound like one)Pros:1. The screen dimensions and phone size is perfect. It's exactly what I need. Not too thick and not extremely flimsy. Though some might prefer the iPhone 7 plus, I think it's too big to carry in your pocket.2. Processor and Speed: this I noticed not just about this iPhone but for iPad also, the processor speed is really awesome. Windows laptops, android phones and tabs do hang and freeze. This phone in last one year has NEVER. It might not sound much of a big deal but usually phones hang when you desperately need them in urgency and you don't want to be in that position ever.3. Screen Quality: the screen looks amazing and Colors are extremely fine.4. Camera: now please note that this is not a DSLR. So no matter how much the phone companies advertise, phone cameras will always be inferior to a professional DLSR. That's the reason why camera companies aren't out of business. Having said that, the camera of this phone (both front and back) are really good and they do their job.6. No Headphone Jack: I thought it would be a matter of concern, but it isn't. It has only motivated me to take care of my headphone even more and that's the only reason they are still intact and working properly. I am sure you won't miss the jack. Besides, if you fear losing the small adapter, it's better to buy Bluetooth headphones. They fit it really well with this phone.7. Cross platform flexibility: this is what I was most worried about. How this device would blend in with my windows laptop and all other apps and features which I earlier used in windows and Android. Surprisingly, the transition was smooth and hassle free. There may be people who disagree, but I never missed any feature which android provided. Infact, itunes, iCloud and other apple features have made the life much easier as compared to android.8. 32 GB storage: I think it's sufficient today. Most people use their phones as storage devices. If you're one of them then even 256GB variant is not enough. So install the apps you actually use, backup the photos in to your laptop regularly, put videos and songs only the ones you listen and actually watch. You will surprise yourself that filling up 32GB space is also difficult.Now, most importantly...CONS:1. Body Finishing: You have to have a back cover for this phone in order to avoid it slipping from your hands. The tighter you grip it without cover, the easily it would slip.Also, I initially used a cover which had a seive pattern on it. The same pattern got imprinted on back of the phone (though not easily visible). Go for an all solid or all plastic cover which can provide grip.2. Battery backup: The battery backup of this phone is bit of a problem. With moderate usage also, it can consume battery before the end of the day and you have to be very economical about it.3. No dual sim: I know, many would frown after reading this. And I know why Apple has still not released a dual sim iPhone.. but I wish this phone was dual sim. The other 2 cons can be mitigated, this one however can only be settled by having a backup phone. Add the Dual sim feature and apple would bring in a swarm of new users who hesitated from iPhone.iPhone ACCESSORIES RECOMMENDATION1. Screen Guard: you may go for any standard screen guard but honestly you don't need one. No screen guard can protect your screen from breaking. I have not used any screen guard for more than year and the screen looks as new. Just make sure you don't put the keys and phone in the same pocket and surely phone will shine for years. Also, let me mention here that my phone HAS FALLEN from a decent height face down on solid floor twice but the glass is strong enough to sustain without absolutely no physical damage.2. Back cover: I think this is a must accessory. You need not spend much on this. Egotude transparent color (black shade) will go perfectly with it. It provides the necessary grip and scratch resistance to your phone back.3. Headphones: in case you lose your Apple earphones, as per your budget, buy a Bluetooth headset, something that suits your pocket and you're good to go.4. Cleaning Spray and Cloth: If you wish to keep your phone new and clean, please invest in this. It's a very small investment but the returns are huge. Buy any camera lens cleaning Spray and soft cloth. Every 10-15 days, take the phone out of cover and thoroughly clean the phone and cover as well. Your phone will shine a little longer and will look brand new for years. All it needs is just a little touch of care from you.Hope the review helps. Cheers 🖖🏻\",\n",
       " 'NOTE:  This review is addressed to that class of people for whom Rs.60000-70000 smartphone is once in five years thing.Before you judge the rating which I have given and draw conclusions, I just want to let people who read this review realize that I am after technology with some innovation and out of the box concept as I never use a smartphone beyond 12 months.  In this process, I literally used every high-end smartphone that was launched after iPhone 3G (my first hold of a smartphone), be it xperia, blackberry, samsung, nexus, HTC, what not!Now, coming to the point of fake ratings.  I am a bit surprised to see so many negative reviews for an iPhone 7 on Amazon.  KINDLY SEE FLIPKART, without the product even launched on their site, there are 864 ratings and as much as 4.9 stars out of 5 and not a single review (I am enclosing a pic for your reference).  So, there is something which doesn\\'t catch our eye.  But these are the lame tricks that get played when you go neck to neck in competition, it applies to either side.ABOUT APPLEUndoubtedly, I give huge credit to Apple for introducing smartphone concept and in the process they slowly killed the once mighty Blackberry.  Like Thomas Edison, credit goes to Apple for inventing such a masterpiece.  But we are still not using the same bulb which Edison has invented.  There are so many companies which are reinventing bulbs every year.  Apple followed it up for few years with some changes in iPhone to keep the customer base solid.  There is so much hype created over every Apple launch and in the process, the adversaries tried to copy the launch styles of Apple.  So, they clearly have the margin.  But, they are surely lagging behind in terms of innovation.  This year iPhone 7 is one that\\'s a perfect example.COMING TO THE PHONEWatched the launch event so closely, like I always do every year.  I was using an iPhone 6 and was waiting for 7 (I have had an occasion to handle and experience both iPhone 7 and 7 plus even before they were launched in India).  And finally ended up with Galaxy S7 Edge for a reason (BEFORE COMMENTING, RE-READ WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN IN THE FIRST TWO PARAGRAPHS OF MY REVIEW).  I opted for S7 Edge for its curvy screen design with brilliant colours and the camera which beats the iPhone  The dual camera on iPhone 7 plus is not new to the world before its launch.  Secondly, they have their eyes set for the 10th Annniversary of iPhone in 2017 and are holding their cards till then.  Both iOS and Android have their own pros and cons.  This is the area which I am carefully and deliberately side lining and focusing on the phone.This year launch of iPhone 7 is only for those geeks, unlike me, who actually stick to iPhone for life and for whom the price tag is just a symbol to flaunt.  Honestly, as most of the Apple users agree, what matters is the design of the phone.  If i see a person standing about 5 feet away from me with an iPhone 7 (not plus) and me holding my iPhone 6, a third person will obviously think we are using the same phone (not talking about brand).  So, if I were to shell Rs.60000 for a phone which retains the same design crafted with precision for three straight years, I better buy a device which satisfies me with its looks and performs as closely as an iPhone but loses the battle.  And with Rs.20000 cheaper.  I put my chips in there.  Unless you have to run tasks which need some significant power like Games, it\\'s not worth an upgrade or a first time buy.lI would request people to just think a bit before investing your hard earned money to go for iPhone 7.  Join the line in which I am standing for the \"revolutionary\" design of an iPhone 8 in 2017.  Because, that\\'s when Apple is gonna show again to the world that they are masters of innovation.All the best!',\n",

       " 'The iPhone 7\\'s notable camera, battery and water resistance improvements are a worthwhile upgrades to a familiar phone design, but ask yourself if you really need an upgrade...and if the Plus might be a better choice.

Apple making almost same design from so many generation. Its nice to having something nice, some thing new. all other competitors are trying for something new.# CAMERA BUMP..... The camera bump looks ugly, If apple had make the device a little bit thicker, there would be no camera bump, and you have the space for BIGGER BATTERY, which will made big deference. It have longer life battery because of optimization of new processor.# BATTERY..... We still don\\'t have the fast charging or wireless charging. Now wireless charging  i get not everybody use this, But fast charger we really need for this. Yes we have fast charger with iPad, but we need fast charger along the iPhone itself, which will charge faster.# HEAD PHONE JACK..... This is a too much of big a deal, Yes they are giving lightning converter, but if you listening something to your headphone wide, working on your phone, and you need to charge, that will be big issue.# MICRO SD CARD SLOT.... Specially i really miss the absence of Micro SD card slot. I think every body is. We really need micro SD slot on iPhone for more space option. But yeah this option will little bit slow down to iPhone performance.# CUSTOMIZABILITY ON IOS.... If you are a person that really like to customize your phone, then ios is definitely not for you.So that is it. Thank You.I THINK IT WILL HELP YOU.Thank you Amazon India',\n",
       " \"Overview - On the outside, the new iPhone looks basically the same as the iPhone 6/6s. They are now water resistant, which is nice, although they’re not fully waterproof, keep them submerged in a meter of water for more than 30 minutes and things might not go your way.Once you wrap your head around the missing audio jack (it's not the end of it, you can get a designated adapter for your favorite headphones), the Apple iPhone 7 is a major upgrade. IP67-certified water-resistant body. Bigger and brighter camera with OIS. New FaceTime cam. Stereo speakers. Faster processor and 50% GPU performance increase, more RAM. New pressure-sensitive Home key powered by a new taptic engine. Revised storage options.Battery - iPhone 7 is powered with the newest A10 Fusion chip. It is a quad core processor which helps in better managing the battery life. It takes around 2hrs to completely charge from 0-100% and the battery usually lasts a day. I am a heavy user, and use the phone quite a lot during the day. Whatsapp, Twitter, Calling and Messaging are the main battery draining apps for me. I will be left with 20-25% battery at the end of the day with typical usage.Performance - Apple made the best mobile chipset from which others can only learn from. Its dual-core processor, even without the help of the tiny energy efficient cores, beats any other processor out there. The A10 GPU is equally impressive acing every graphic benchmark. The iPhone 7 is the fastest and most powerful smartphone in the world as of now.Audio - iPhone 7 has stereo speakers, considering my previous iPhone was the 5s, it is a huge upgrade for me in the audio performance. Loudspeaker is pretty good, audio output is loud and clear. Call quality is damn good.Camera - The colors and contrast are great and the dynamic range is simply great - much like you would get on dedicated big cameras. In any case, the iPhone 7 delivers the most balanced dynamic range from any smartphone at the moment. The optical image stabilization is the addition that really matters as it will keep the lens steady and won't allow for blurry shots at low-light. The front-facing camera got its resolution boosted to 7MP and records 1080p video. It can use Retina flash, where your screen lights up in different colors depending on the intended white balance of the scene. Pretty good when taking selfies in dark environment. Coming to the 4k video recording, it is the best camera when it comes to 4k Video, Period.Overall a great package and the phone will definitely last 3+ years if used carefully. There won't be any performance issues considering Apple will provide updates regularly and the phone won't lag after using it for a year or so unlike the android phones. The phone is also water and dust resistant, if we accidentally end up dropping the phone in water, there is no need to worry. The phone can even be used to take pictures in swimming pool and shallow water(Be careful with the depth of water else phone will be toast). Putting a case and a screen protector will ruin the beauty of phone and the phone won't feel the same, but if you are the one who drops the phone constantly then Case and Screen protectors are necessary evils. I got it for a price of 36500/- in the Great Indian Sale :pAbsolutely Loving it !!\",\n",
       " 'I got the delivery of this phone on December 30th. I bought an iphone 7 specifically because of the button when I broke my old 6S.Since the day I bought this phone, it had been showing battery drain and overheating. I thought it would be due to the intense icloud downloads that the phone was doing in the background. Ever since day 1, the phone wouldn\\'t receive calls or can make calls. I thought it would be a network issue.I tried doing a return after 2 days noticing the phone\\'s not showing any signs of proper useability without a charger at hand at all times. But Amazon would not allow me to return it saying contact Apple support. Now apple support was on Holidays till 3rd of January.Finally when I got to Apple support, they have done a diagnostic and couldn\\'t find anything unusual, but asked me to observe for 3 more days. 3 more days, I contacted Apple for them to tell me to take it to a service center. Still cannot make phone calls or receive them. I tried returning through multiple different options, which all led me back to amazon responding saying contact apple support. I went to the Vodafone store to confirm if I had any network issues, only for them to find out, no matter which sim they put in my phone, it will not make or receive phone calls.So I went to the service centre for them to keep my phone under observation for another 5 days. And they acknowledged the phone\\'s showing temperature and battery drain, but since Apple diagnosis isn\\'t showing any issues, they asked me to continue using the phone for another 1-2 weeks.Now, as they did restore the phone, I tried coming back home with my sim card, only to see, the same issue, that I cannot make phone calls or receive them. I can send/receive text messages. I contacted Apple support again, for them to acknowledge now that there is an issue and I have to send it for service.Now as the return period is conveniently over, Amazon refuses to do anything to take the faulty product back. I have wasted 2 weeks of time and energy running around trying to get this phone fixed, only to waste another week or two for the phone to go out and get repaired and come back.Amazon has responded asking me to get a \"service denied letter\" from Apple support for them to refund and take return of this product that I have wasted 2 weeks on.So, long story short, go buy it from a local store. You buy it from Amazon, be prepared to chase tails and run around like headless chicken to sort out any issue you\\'re facing. Worse, if you\\'re in a place with no local authorised apple service centre.']"
